Judge evaluation checklist:
- Each edge receives a credibility score (A/B/C/D) with reasons.
- Weak-link list prioritizes edges on the target path.
- Suggested refinements are specific, testable, and logged in the spec ledger.
- No iterative p-hacking: changes are justified and documented.
- System report updated in outputs/agentic/cards/judge.
