DataScout evaluation checklist:
- Coverage: all NodeSpecs resolved to at least one DataAsset or flagged missing.
- Provenance: each DataAsset includes source URL/API, access date, and checksum.
- Quality: missingness, frequency, and structural break checks reported.
- Backward compatibility: reuses shared.data clients or study pipelines when possible.
- Catalog: DataCards stored in outputs/agentic/cards/data with stable IDs.
