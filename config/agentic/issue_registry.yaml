  - rule_id: ENTITY_BOUNDARY_DRIFT
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Mixing entity scopes (bank vs group) breaks comparability"
    explanation: >
      When different observations mix entity scopes (e.g., bank-level vs consolidated
      group-level), the treatment and outcome variables become incomparable across units.
      Capital ratios at bank level differ systematically from group level due to intra-group
      transfers and double counting. Ignoring this produces biased panel estimates because
      the variation being exploited is partly definitional, not economic.
    guidance: >
      Harmonize all observations to the same scope (preferably unconsolidated bank-level
      for Kazakhstan data). If harmonization is impossible, add a scope dummy and note
      the caveat in the report.

  - rule_id: KPI_DEFINITION_MISMATCH_CROSS_BANK
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: cross_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "NPL/CoR definitions differ across banks causing sign conflicts"
    explanation: >
      Banks may use different definitions for key performance indicators (e.g., NPL
      includes/excludes restructured loans, CoR uses different provisioning rules).
      Cross-bank panel estimation treats these as comparable, but definitional differences
      create measurement error correlated with bank characteristics. This can flip
      coefficient signs between runs and invalidate pooled estimates.
    guidance: >
      Check if the definition mismatch is economically meaningful. If yes, harmonize
      definitions or estimate separately by definition group. Document any remaining
      heterogeneity as a limitation.

  - rule_id: SHOCK_CONSTRUCT_AMBIGUOUS
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "EdgeCard must include shock_node_id, shock_unit, shock_scale"
    explanation: >
      Without explicit shock metadata (which node is shocked, in what units, at what
      scale), counterfactual scenarios become ambiguous. A "10% depreciation" could mean
      10 percentage points or 10% of the current level, leading to order-of-magnitude
      errors in propagation. This metadata is required for reproducible counterfactuals.
    guidance: >
      The system will auto-populate shock metadata from the DAG spec. Verify that the
      inferred shock_unit and shock_scale match your intended scenario.

  - rule_id: FREQUENCY_ALIGNMENT_ERROR
    severity: CRITICAL
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Mixing frequencies without explicit aggregation rule"
    explanation: >
      Mixing monthly treatment with quarterly outcome (or vice versa) without a declared
      aggregation method (end-of-period, average, sum) introduces temporal misalignment.
      The estimator may silently interpolate or drop observations, changing the effective
      sample and potentially biasing results. This is auto-fixable but must be logged.
    guidance: >
      The system will apply the aggregation rule from the DAG spec. If no rule is
      specified, it defaults to end-of-period for stocks and average for flows.

  - rule_id: FREQUENCY_SCALING_MISMATCH
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: cross_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Annual vs quarterly estimates not normalized to common unit"
    explanation: >
      When comparing estimates across runs with different frequencies, a quarterly
      coefficient is not directly comparable to an annual one. Failing to normalize
      (e.g., annualize quarterly or quarterly-ize annual) leads to incorrect propagation
      multipliers and misleading cross-run convergence assessments.
    guidance: >
      Normalize all estimates to a common time unit before comparison. The preferred
      convention is quarterly for macro variables and annual for structural parameters.

  - rule_id: EXTRACTION_PROVENANCE_GAPS
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: false
    description: "Missing source document/page reference for extracted data"
    explanation: >
      Data extracted from PDFs, reports, or regulatory filings should carry provenance
      (source document, page, table number) so that results can be independently verified.
      Missing provenance makes reproduction impossible and raises audit risk, especially
      for regulatory submissions.
    guidance: >
      Add the source reference to the data extraction metadata. For low-risk variables
      (e.g., public market data), this can be accepted with a note.

  # Identification / Design Problems
  # =========================================================================
  - rule_id: REACTION_FUNCTION_EDGE
    severity: CRITICAL
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Policy reaction edge cannot be used for shock propagation"
    explanation: >
      A policy reaction function (e.g., central bank raises rates in response to
      inflation) captures endogenous behavior, not a causal effect of an exogenous shock.
      Using it for shock propagation would double-count the policy response or create
      circular logic. The edge should be classified as diagnostic or informational only.
    guidance: >
      Reclassify as diagnostic-only if this is purely a reaction function. If you believe
      there is an exogenous component, document the identification strategy and accept
      with a caveat.

  - rule_id: TIME_FE_ABSORBS_SHOCK
    severity: CRITICAL
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Panel with time FE and common shock requires Exposure x Shock"
    explanation: >
      Time fixed effects absorb all common time-varying shocks (including the treatment
      of interest if it is a macro shock common to all units). To identify the effect,
      the design must exploit cross-sectional variation in exposure (Exposure x Shock
      interaction). Without this, the coefficient is mechanically zero or identified only
      from noise.
    guidance: >
      The system will suggest adding an Exposure x Shock interaction term. This is the
      standard diff-in-diff approach for common shocks in panel data.

  - rule_id: EXPOSURE_NOT_PREDETERMINED
    severity: CRITICAL
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Exposure variable must be measured strictly pre-treatment"
    explanation: >
      If the exposure variable (e.g., bank's FX share) is measured contemporaneously with
      or after the shock, it may itself be affected by the shock, creating a "bad controls"
      problem. This violates the exclusion restriction in diff-in-diff designs and biases
      the estimated causal effect, typically attenuating it toward zero.
    guidance: >
      Lag the exposure variable to a pre-treatment period. If pre-treatment measurement
      is unavailable, accept with a caveat noting potential attenuation bias.

  - rule_id: MECHANICAL_EDGE_ESTIMATED
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Accounting identity should be bridge, not regression"
    explanation: >
      Regressing an identity (e.g., CAR = Capital / RWA) produces tautological results
      with near-perfect fit, inflating credibility scores and wasting estimation budget.
      Mechanical edges should be treated as deterministic bridges that pass through shocks
      via calculus (partial derivatives), not statistical estimation.
    guidance: >
      The system will convert this to a bridge edge with deterministic sensitivity.
      Accept as regression only if you need to test whether the identity holds empirically.

  - rule_id: PATH_DOUBLE_COUNTING
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Direct reduced-form + indirect chain both used for propagation"
    resolution_policy: |
      Each edge must have propagation_role: structural | reduced_form | bridge | diagnostic_only.
      The counterfactual engine enforces: cannot simultaneously use a reduced_form shortcut edge
      AND the full structural decomposition path for the same causal channel.
      If both exist, HITL must choose which to use (or config flag selects default).
      Default: prefer structural chain if all intermediate edges are IDENTIFIED_CAUSAL;
      fall back to reduced_form otherwise.
    explanation: >
      If both a direct reduced-form edge (A -> C) and a structural chain (A -> B -> C)
      are included in propagation, the total effect is double-counted. This inflates
      counterfactual predictions, potentially by 100% or more. The system detects overlapping
      paths and requires the analyst to choose one.
    guidance: >
      Prefer the structural chain if all intermediate edges are IDENTIFIED_CAUSAL, as it
      provides more granular policy levers. Use reduced-form if intermediate edges are
      weak or if you only need the total effect.

  - rule_id: SIGNIFICANT_BUT_NOT_IDENTIFIED
    severity: CRITICAL
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    action: "cap_rating_C, block_counterfactual"
    description: "Significant result but claim_level != IDENTIFIED_CAUSAL"
    explanation: >
      This edge shows a statistically significant result (low p-value), but the
      identification strategy has not been validated as causal. A significant correlation
      is not the same as a causal effect — without proper identification (e.g., IV, RDD,
      DiD), the estimate may reflect reverse causation, omitted variable bias, or spurious
      correlation. Accepting this as causal without acknowledgement constitutes overclaiming.
    guidance: >
      If you have a credible identification strategy, upgrade to IDENTIFIED_CAUSAL and
      document it. Otherwise, accept as REDUCED_FORM — informative but not usable for
      counterfactual predictions without caveats.

  # Statistical Inference Problems

  - rule_id: SMALL_SAMPLE_INFERENCE
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: false
    action: "cap_rating_B"
    description: "N < 30 with HAC SEs; inference fragile"
    explanation: >
      With fewer than 30 observations, HAC (Newey-West) standard errors rely on
      asymptotic approximations that perform poorly in small samples. Confidence intervals
      may be too narrow, leading to false rejections of the null. The credibility rating
      is capped to reflect this uncertainty.
    guidance: >
      Consider wild bootstrap for more reliable small-sample inference. The rating cap
      to B is automatic; override only if you have strong justification for asymptotic
      validity.

  - rule_id: PANEL_TOO_FEW_UNITS
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: false
    action: "cap_rating_B"
    description: "< 5 units; cluster-robust unreliable"
    explanation: >
      Cluster-robust standard errors require a sufficient number of clusters (units) to
      be reliable. With fewer than 5 units, the cluster-robust variance estimator is
      severely biased downward, leading to over-rejection. This is a well-known problem
      in the panel econometrics literature (Cameron, Gelbach, Miller 2008).
    guidance: >
      Use wild cluster bootstrap (Webb weights) for valid inference with few clusters.
      The rating cap to B is automatic. Accept with caveat if bootstrap is infeasible.

  - rule_id: LOO_INSTABILITY
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    action: "cap_rating_C"
    description: "Leave-one-out shows sign flip or >50% magnitude change"
    explanation: >
      Leave-one-out (LOO) analysis drops each unit in turn and re-estimates. If the
      coefficient flips sign or changes magnitude by more than 50%, the result is driven
      by a single influential unit rather than a systematic pattern. Such fragility
      undermines confidence in the estimate as a general causal effect.
    guidance: >
      Identify the influential unit and investigate whether it is an outlier or represents
      a genuine subgroup effect. Consider winsorizing, trimming, or reporting results
      with and without the influential unit.

  - rule_id: BREAKS_UNMODELED
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Regime changes not accounted for in estimation"
    explanation: >
      Structural breaks (e.g., policy changes, crises) can cause coefficient instability.
      If breaks are present but not modeled, the estimated coefficient is a weighted average
      across regimes, which may not represent either regime accurately. This is especially
      problematic for counterfactual scenarios that project beyond a break date.
    guidance: >
      Add a regime dummy or split the sample at the break date. If the break is recent
      and data post-break is insufficient, restrict counterfactual scope to the
      pre-break regime.

  - rule_id: MULTIPLE_TESTING_DRIFT
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: cross_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Spec search exceeded pre-registered budget"
    explanation: >
      Running many specifications and reporting only the significant one inflates the
      false discovery rate. The pre-registered specification budget limits this. If the
      budget is exceeded, the analyst must either apply a multiple testing correction
      (e.g., Bonferroni) or justify the additional specifications as pre-planned robustness
      checks.
    guidance: >
      Apply Bonferroni correction to the p-values if the budget was exceeded due to
      exploratory analysis. If the additional specs were planned robustness checks,
      document them and reset the budget.

  # =========================================================================

  - rule_id: NONSTATIONARY_LEVELS_RISK
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Both variables in levels and trending; require transformation or ECM"
    explanation: >
      Regressing two trending (non-stationary) variables in levels produces spurious
      regression — high R-squared and significant t-statistics that reflect shared trends,
      not causal relationships. The solution is to first-difference, use an ECM if
      cointegrated, or apply appropriate transformations (log-differences for growth rates).
    guidance: >
      The system will apply first-differencing by default. If you believe the variables
      are cointegrated, select ECM specification to preserve the long-run relationship.

  - rule_id: RESIDUAL_AUTOCORR_DETECTED
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: false
    description: "Serial correlation in residuals; HAC SEs may be inadequate"
    explanation: >
      Serial correlation in residuals indicates that the model is missing dynamic structure.
      While HAC standard errors adjust for this, they may be inadequate if the autocorrelation
      is strong or persistent, leading to under-estimated standard errors and over-rejection.
    guidance: >
      Consider increasing the HAC bandwidth or adding lagged dependent variables. If
      autocorrelation is mild (DW close to 2), accept with a caveat.

  - rule_id: REGIME_BREAK_SUSPECTED
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Coefficient instability across regime splits"
    explanation: >
      TSGuard detected statistically significant coefficient differences across time
      sub-samples, suggesting a structural break. Using a single coefficient for the full
      sample masks regime-specific effects and produces unreliable counterfactuals for
      periods after the break.
    guidance: >
      Split the sample at the detected break date and estimate separately. If the break
      is too recent for reliable post-break estimation, restrict counterfactual scope
      to the pre-break regime.

  - rule_id: LEADS_SIGNIFICANT_TIMING_FAIL
    severity: CRITICAL
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: false
    action: "block_propagation"
    description: "Effects appear before shock; reverse causation or omitted factor"
    explanation: >
      If the outcome responds significantly BEFORE the treatment shock, the causal
      interpretation fails. This indicates either reverse causation (outcome causes
      treatment), an omitted common factor driving both, or anticipation effects that
      violate the parallel trends assumption. The edge is blocked from propagation
      automatically.
    guidance: >
      Investigate whether leads reflect anticipation (expected policy changes) or reverse
      causation. If anticipation, consider adjusting the shock timing. If reverse
      causation, reclassify the edge direction or remove from the DAG.

  - rule_id: HAC_LAG_SENSITIVITY_HIGH
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: false
    description: "Estimate changes materially with HAC lag length"
    explanation: >
      If the point estimate or its significance changes substantially when varying the HAC
      bandwidth (number of lags in the Newey-West kernel), the inference is fragile to the
      choice of bandwidth. This suggests that the serial correlation structure is complex
      and the standard errors are not robust to bandwidth selection.
    guidance: >
      Report results across multiple bandwidths. Use a data-driven bandwidth selector
      (e.g., Andrews 1991) rather than ad hoc choice. Accept with caveat if the sign is
      stable across bandwidths.

  # =========================================================================
  # Selection / External Validity Problems

  - rule_id: SELECTION_PUBLIC_BANK_ONLY
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    action: "add_report_disclaimer, cap_counterfactual_scope"
    description: "Panel uses only public banks; results may not generalize to full banking sector"
    explanation: >
      Public (listed) banks differ systematically from private banks in size, governance,
      risk appetite, and regulatory scrutiny. Estimates from public-only samples may not
      generalize to the full banking sector. Counterfactuals applied to the full sector
      using these estimates would be unreliable for the private bank segment.
    guidance: >
      Add a disclaimer noting the sample restriction. Cap the counterfactual scope to
      public banks only, or accept with a clear caveat about external validity limitations.

  - rule_id: SURVIVORSHIP_BIAS_RISK
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Sample excludes failed/merged banks; survival conditioning biases estimates"
    explanation: >
      If banks that failed, merged, or exited the sample are excluded, the remaining
      sample is conditioned on survival. This creates survivorship bias — the estimated
      effects reflect only the experience of survivors, typically underestimating the
      negative effects of shocks (since the most affected banks disappeared).
    guidance: >
      Run a sensitivity check including failed/merged banks up to their last observation.
      Add a disclaimer about survivorship bias. If data on exits is unavailable, accept
      with a clear caveat.

  - rule_id: COVERAGE_GAP_EXTERNAL_VALIDITY
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    action: "add_report_disclaimer"
    description: "Sample covers <50% of system assets or <50% of institutions in target population"
    explanation: >
      When the sample covers less than half of the target population (by assets or count),
      the estimated effects may not represent the system as a whole. Small or mid-sized
      banks excluded from the sample may have different exposure patterns and response
      mechanisms than the included banks.
    guidance: >
      Add a disclaimer noting the coverage gap. If the coverage gap is due to data
      availability, document which segments are missing and their likely direction of bias.

  - rule_id: RATING_DIAGNOSTICS_CONFLICT
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "A-rating despite failed diagnostics or missing requirements"
    explanation: >
      An A-rating signals high credibility, but one or more diagnostics have failed or
      required checks are missing. This inconsistency undermines the rating system's
      integrity. The system auto-downgrades to B to maintain consistency between the
      rating and the underlying evidence.
    guidance: >
      The auto-downgrade to B is applied. Override to A only if you can document why the
      failed diagnostic does not affect the estimate's credibility for your specific use case.

  - rule_id: N_REPORTING_INCONSISTENT
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Report N header != EdgeCard N_eff"
    explanation: >
      The sample size reported in the system report header differs from the effective
      observations in the EdgeCard. This inconsistency confuses reviewers and may indicate
      a data processing error (e.g., missing values were dropped but not reflected in the
      header count).
    guidance: >
      The system will auto-fix by aligning the report N to the EdgeCard N_eff. Accept the
      auto-fix unless you have a specific reason for the discrepancy.

  - rule_id: CROSS_EVIDENCE_CONFLICT
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: cross_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Two edges measuring same relationship have conflicting signs"
    explanation: >
      When two edges estimate the same causal relationship (e.g., one reduced-form and
      one structural) but produce opposite signs, at least one is biased or misspecified.
      Using both in propagation would produce contradictory counterfactuals. The analyst
      must adjudicate which estimate is more credible.
    guidance: >
      Prefer the structural edge if its identification strategy is stronger. If both
      designs are equally credible, report the conflict as a limitation and consider
      averaging with appropriate uncertainty.

  - rule_id: ORPHAN_NODE_UNCONNECTED
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Node not connected to any edge; unreachable in propagation"
    explanation: >
      A node exists in the DAG but does not appear in any edge's from/to
      or latent's affects list. If the node has an identity formula whose
      components are all present in the DAG, an identity edge can be
      auto-created. Otherwise, human intervention is required to either
      add a causal edge with estimation backing or remove the node.
    guidance: >
      For identity-resolvable orphans, the system creates a deterministic
      identity edge and edge card. For others, add an edge with proper
      estimation or remove the orphan node from the DAG.

  - rule_id: TARGET_UNREACHABLE
    severity: CRITICAL
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Target node is unreachable from any root node in the DAG"
    explanation: >
      The target node (the variable the DAG is designed to explain) cannot be
      reached by following edges from any exogenous root node. This means the
      causal narrative is structurally broken — shocks cannot propagate to the
      target. Common causes include missing identity edges, disconnected
      components, or incomplete narrative extraction.
    guidance: >
      Add the missing edges that connect the exogenous shock chain to the target.
      For identity nodes (e.g., K2 = Capital / RWA), ensure both identity
      component edges exist.

  - rule_id: IDENTITY_DEPS_INCOMPLETE
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Derived node's identity formula has dependencies without edges"
    explanation: >
      A derived node has an identity formula (e.g., K2 = Capital / RWA) that
      references dependency nodes, but one or more of those dependencies lack
      an edge pointing to the derived node. This breaks the accounting identity
      chain and prevents correct propagation through the identity relationship.
    guidance: >
      The system will auto-create identity edges from each dependency to the
      derived node. Accept if the dependencies are correctly specified in the
      formula.

  - rule_id: SINK_NODE_NOT_TARGET
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: false
    requires_human: true
    description: "Non-target node absorbs information but does not transmit downstream"
    explanation: >
      A node has incoming edges but no outgoing edges, yet it is not the DAG's
      target node. This means information (shocks) flow into this node but are
      absorbed without transmitting further. If the node is meant to influence
      downstream variables, the missing outgoing edge represents a gap in the
      causal narrative.
    guidance: >
      Either add an outgoing edge to connect this node downstream, or accept
      this as a terminal diagnostic node that is not part of the propagation
      chain.

  - rule_id: EDGE_ID_SYNTAX_INVALID
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Edge ID contains spaces, arrows, or other invalid characters"
    explanation: >
      Edge IDs must be valid snake_case identifiers (lowercase letters, digits,
      underscores only). IDs containing spaces, arrows (->), parentheses, or
      other special characters cause filesystem errors when saving EdgeCards
      and break downstream tooling that expects clean identifiers.
    guidance: >
      The system will auto-sanitize the edge ID by converting arrows to _to_,
      removing special characters, and collapsing consecutive underscores.

  - rule_id: IDENTITY_FORMULA_DOUBLE_TRANSFORM

      A derived node's identity formula contains log(X) where X already has
      transforms: [log], meaning the data is already in log levels. Applying
      log() again would double-log the variable, producing incorrect results.
      This is usually a documentation convention issue rather than a runtime
      bug, but it creates ambiguity about whether the formula represents a
      mathematical operation or a label.
    guidance: >
      If the convention is that transforms: [log] means "data stored in log
      form", then the formula should use the variable name directly (e.g.,
      X - Y instead of log(X) - log(Y)). Update the formula to match.

  - rule_id: LOADER_FAILED
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: pre_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Primary and fallback data loaders both failed for a node"
    explanation: >
      The DynamicLoaderFactory could not build a loader for a DAG node from
      any of its declared source specs (preferred + fallback). This prevents
      estimation of all edges involving this node. The DataResolverAgent can
      attempt to discover and download data from external APIs.
    guidance: >
      The system will dispatch to the DataResolverAgent, which uses LLM
      tool-use to search data catalogs (World Bank, FRED, IMF, DBnomics),
      fetch matching indicators, and register loaders. If automated
      resolution fails, drop a data file into data/raw/ and re-run.

  - rule_id: DATA_INSUFFICIENT_EDGE
    severity: HIGH
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Edge estimation produced fewer than 5 observations after alignment"
    explanation: >
      After aligning treatment and outcome series in time, fewer than 5
      usable observations remain. This is typically caused by frequency
      mismatch (annual vs monthly), non-overlapping date ranges, or
      excessive NaN values. The estimate is unreliable and marked with
      rating D.
    guidance: >
      The DataResolverAgent can attempt to find a higher-frequency version
      of the data or a longer time series from an alternative provider.
      If this fails, the edge should be excluded from propagation.

  - rule_id: ALIGNMENT_FAILURE
    severity: MEDIUM
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "Treatment and outcome series have no overlapping date range"
    explanation: >
      The two series for an edge have completely disjoint date ranges,
      making estimation impossible. This often happens when one series
      is annual (e.g., from World Bank) and the other is monthly, or
      when one series ends before the other begins.
    guidance: >
      The system will attempt frequency resampling (forward-fill annual
      to monthly) or search for an alternative series with better coverage.
      If alignment is impossible, the edge is excluded from estimation.

  - rule_id: UNIT_MISSING_IN_EDGECARD
    severity: CRITICAL
    trigger: post_run
    auto_fixable: true
    requires_human: false
    description: "EdgeCard missing treatment_unit/outcome_unit"
    explanation: >
      Without explicit units (e.g., "pp", "%", "log points"), the coefficient is
      uninterpretable. A coefficient of 0.5 could mean 0.5 percentage points, 50%, or
      0.5 log points — a potential 100x difference in the implied effect. Units are
      required for any meaningful propagation or reporting.
    guidance: >
      The system will auto-populate units from the DAG spec. Verify that the inferred
      units match the actual estimation specification.
