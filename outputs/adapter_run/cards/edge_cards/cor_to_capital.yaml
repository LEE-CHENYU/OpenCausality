    excerpt: The realization of sustainable social rental housing is regarded as an
      important policy to solve the housing burden, but social rental housing is often
      unsustainable. This study assesses the sustainability of social rental housing.
      However, the decision-making models, such as the classical decision-

    excerpt: Indonesia is at a crossroads in building its welfare regime. The study
      seeks to analyse the salient characteristics and enabling factors that influence
      Indonesia’s current social policies in light of welfare state theories. The

    year: 2021
    excerpt: 'Accurate modeling of operational risk is important for a bank and the
      finance industry as a whole to prepare for potentially catastrophic losses.
      One approach to modeling operational is the loss distribution approach, which
      requires a bank to group operational losses into risk categories and select '

    title: Sequential Design and Spatial Modeling for Portfolio Tail Risk Measurement
    authors:
    - Michael Ludkovski
    - James Risk
    year: 2017
    excerpt: We consider calculation of capital requirements when the underlying economic
      scenarios are determined by simulatable risk factors. In the respective nested
      simulation framework, the goal is to estimate portfolio tail risk, quantified
      via VaR or TVaR of a given collection of future economic scenarios
