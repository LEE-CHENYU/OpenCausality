    excerpt: Economic fluctuations can be caused by demand shocks and supply shocks.
      One of the supply shocks is caused by changes in world crude oil prices. As
      a net importer of crude oil, any change in crude oil prices makes domestic economic
      activity vulnerable to these shocks. The purpose of this study is to
