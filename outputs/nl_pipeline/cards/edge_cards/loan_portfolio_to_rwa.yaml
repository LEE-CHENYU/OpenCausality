    excerpt: Using daily returns of the S&P 500 stocks from 2001 to 2011, we perform
      a backtesting study of the portfolio optimization strategy based on the extreme
      risk index (ERI). This method uses multivariate extreme value theory to minimize
      the probability of large portfolio losses. With more than 400 stock

    excerpt: Portfolio managers often evaluate performance relative to benchmark,
      usually taken to be the Standard & Poor 500 stock index fund. This relative
      portfolio wealth is defined as the absolute portfolio wealth divided by wealth
      from investing in the benchmark (including reinvested dividends). The classi

    year: 2019
    excerpt: The popularity of modern portfolio theory has decreased among practitioners
      because of its unfavorable out-of-sample performance. Estimation errors tend
      to affect the optimal weight calculation noticeably, especially when a large
      number of assets is considered. To overcome these issues, many methods
