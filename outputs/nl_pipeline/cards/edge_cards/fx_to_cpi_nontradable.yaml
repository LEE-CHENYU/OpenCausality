    excerpt: This Selected Issues Paper evaluates Kazakhstan’s oil rules, current
      fiscal stance, and long-term sustainability. The sharp and sustained drop in
      oil prices since 2014 has reduced the value of Kazakhstan’s oil wealth. Kazakhstan’s
      non-oil deficit path has been higher than suggested by long-term benc

    year: 2019
    excerpt: Recent interest in the external validity of prediction models (i.e.,
      the problem of different train and test distributions, known as dataset shift)
      has produced many methods for finding predictive distributions that are invariant
      to dataset shifts and can be used for prediction in new, unseen enviro

    year: 2021
    excerpt: Using observed language to understand interpersonal interactions is important
      in high-stakes decision making. We propose a causal research design for observational
      (non-experimental) data to estimate the natural direct and indirect effects
      of social group signals (e.g. race or gender) on speakers' r

    year: 2022
    excerpt: We present quantitative probing as a model-agnostic framework for validating
      causal models in the presence of quantitative domain knowledge. The method is
      constructed as an analogue of the train/test split in correlation-based machine
      learning and as an enhancement of current causal validation strat
