    year: 2013
    excerpt: We analyze the effect of rising Chinese import competition between 1990
      and 2007 on US local labor markets, exploiting cross-market variation in import
      exposure stemming from initial differences in industry specialization and instrumenting
      for US imports using changes in Chinese imports by other hig

    excerpt: This paper considers a simple quantitative model of output, interest
      rate and inflation determination in the United States, and uses it to evaluate
      alternative rules by which the Fed may set interest rates. The model is derived
      from optimizing behavior under rational expectations, both on the part o

    year: 2024
    excerpt: We study the asymmetric effect of consumption expenditure on Saudi imports
      from 1991 to 2020. We found a direct relationship between consumption expenditure
      and imports both in short and long-run periods, however, the positive shocks
      in consumption expenditures have a dominant impact in the long run
