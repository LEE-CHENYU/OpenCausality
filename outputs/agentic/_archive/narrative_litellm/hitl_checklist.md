## Pending Decisions

### 1. Regime Instability Decision
- **Edge:** `vix_shock__to__cor_kspi_macro_provisioning`
- **Suggested:** Split estimand by regime or restrict counterfactual scope
- [ ] Decision: _________________

### 2. p=0.0102 but claim_level=REDUCED_FORM. Significance does not establish causation.
- **Edge:** `real_expenditure_pos__marketplace_revenue_kspi`
- **Why this matters:** This edge shows a statistically significant result (low p-value), but the identification strategy has not been validated as causal. A significant correlation is not the same as a causal effect — without proper identification (e.g., IV, RDD, DiD), the estimate may reflect reverse causation, omitted variable bias, or spurious correlation. Accepting this as causal without acknowledgement constitutes overclaiming.

- **Decision guidance:** If you have a credible identification strategy, upgrade to IDENTIFIED_CAUSAL and document it. Otherwise, accept as REDUCED_FORM — informative but not usable for counterfactual predictions without caveats.

- pvalue: 0.010206791740876794
- claim_level: REDUCED_FORM
- [ ] Decision: _________________

### 3. p=0.0000 but claim_level=BLOCKED_ID. Significance does not establish causation.
- **Edge:** `ppop_kspi_minus_provisions_to_total_capital_kspi`
- **Why this matters:** This edge shows a statistically significant result (low p-value), but the identification strategy has not been validated as causal. A significant correlation is not the same as a causal effect — without proper identification (e.g., IV, RDD, DiD), the estimate may reflect reverse causation, omitted variable bias, or spurious correlation. Accepting this as causal without acknowledgement constitutes overclaiming.

- **Decision guidance:** If you have a credible identification strategy, upgrade to IDENTIFIED_CAUSAL and document it. Otherwise, accept as REDUCED_FORM — informative but not usable for counterfactual predictions without caveats.

### 4. p=0.0003 but claim_level=BLOCKED_ID. Significance does not establish causation.
- **Edge:** `nbk_rate_to_deposit_cost`

A significant correlation is not the same as a causal effect — without proper identification (e.g., IV, RDD, DiD), the estimate may reflect reverse causation, omitted variable bias, or spurious correlation.
