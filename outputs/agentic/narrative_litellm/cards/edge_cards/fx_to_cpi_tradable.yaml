    excerpt: This Selected Issues Paper evaluates Kazakhstan’s oil rules, current
      fiscal stance, and long-term sustainability. The sharp and sustained drop in
      oil prices since 2014 has reduced the value of Kazakhstan’s oil wealth. Kazakhstan’s
      non-oil deficit path has been higher than suggested by long-term benc

    year: 2019
    excerpt: Recent interest in the external validity of prediction models (i.e.,
      the problem of different train and test distributions, known as dataset shift)
      has produced many methods for finding predictive distributions that are invariant
      to dataset shifts and can be used for prediction in new, unseen enviro

    excerpt: Studies show that countries blessed with an abundance of natural resources

      by the fact that there are relatively few studies conducted on a natu

    excerpt: We present quantitative probing as a model-agnostic framework for validating
      causal models in the presence of quantitative domain knowledge. The method is
      constructed as an analogue of the train/test split in correlation-based machine
      learning and as an enhancement of current causal validation strat
