  "oil_shock_to_oil_price": "An oil supply shock is associated with an immediate change in the oil price, capturing how unexpected disruptions in production or distribution co-move with spot prices contemporaneously. A key risk is that the \u201csupply shock\u201d measure may be contaminated by endogenous responses to demand conditions or by simultaneous news about global activity, which would make the reduced-form coefficient reflect more than supply-side variation; measurement timing (e.g., using prices that already incorporate information) can also bias the contemporaneous estimate. Next, the researcher should validate the shock\u2019s exogeneity by checking whether it predicts pre-trends in global demand indicators and by confirming the timing with high-frequency event windows (e.g., around geopolitical disruptions) to ensure the price move is not driven by concurrent demand or policy news.",
  "oil_to_cpi_headline": "Higher oil prices are associated with higher headline CPI because oil feeds directly into consumer energy prices (gasoline, heating oil) and indirectly into transportation and production costs that can pass through to retail prices. A key risk is that oil prices and CPI may co-move due to common global shocks (e.g., demand expansions, supply disruptions, exchange rate movements) or policy responses, so the reduced-form estimate may not reflect pure pass-through; additionally, timing/aggregation (monthly CPI vs. daily oil) and regulated/contracted energy pricing can attenuate the measured association, consistent with the near-zero, imprecise estimate here. Next, a researcher should check the dynamic response with distributed lags and energy vs. core CPI, and test robustness to controlling for global activity measures and exchange rates or using plausibly exogenous oil supply shocks as an instrument.",
  "oil_to_cpi_core": "Higher oil prices are associated with slightly higher core CPI, consistent with indirect pass-through via transportation and input costs, as well as firms\u2019 pricing responses that gradually show up beyond energy components; the small coefficient fits the idea that core inflation reacts less and with a lag compared to headline. A key risk is that oil prices may be proxying for broader macro conditions (global demand, supply-chain disruptions, exchange rates, monetary policy responses) that also move core inflation, so the estimate could reflect omitted variables or policy endogeneity rather than pass-through. Researchers should check robustness to controlling for aggregate demand and policy (e.g., output gap/unemployment, exchange rate, policy rate surprises), examine lag structures and impulse responses (distributed lags/VAR), and test whether the relationship weakens when using plausibly exogenous oil supply shocks instead of spot oil price movements.",
  "oil_to_industrial": "An increase in oil prices may reduce industrial production by raising energy and transportation input costs and compressing firms\u2019 margins, consistent with the Hamilton (oil shock) channel and demand spillovers from higher consumer fuel spending. A key risk is that the observed relationship could be driven by common shocks\u2014e.g., global demand expansions that raise both oil prices and industrial output, or monetary policy responses to inflation\u2014so the edge is plausibly blocked rather than a clean causal effect (and the estimate is only marginally significant at conventional levels). The researcher should check which paths are blocked in the DAG and whether conditioning choices open collider bias, then probe robustness with alternative oil shock measures (e.g., exogenous supply disruptions or \u201cnet oil price increases\u201d), different lags, and controls for global activity (e.g., Kilian index) and policy rates.",
  "oil_to_vix": "Higher oil prices are associated with changes in the VIX, consistent with the idea that oil price spikes coincide with heightened macro/financial uncertainty and repricing of risk in equity markets. A key risk is that the estimate may reflect common shocks (e.g., global demand news, geopolitical events, or monetary policy surprises) that move both oil prices and risk sentiment, as well as reverse timing where rising risk aversion affects commodity prices; measurement/timing mismatches and omitted controls can also bias the reduced-form relationship. Next, the researcher should check sensitivity to controlling for major confounders (global activity indicators, policy rates, credit spreads, equity returns), examine lead\u2013lag structure (does oil predict future VIX or just co-move contemporaneously), and test stability across regimes (crisis vs. normal periods) and alternative oil benchmarks (WTI vs. Brent).",
  "oil_to_sentiment": "Higher oil prices are associated with lower consumer sentiment, plausibly because they pass through to gasoline and other energy costs that squeeze real disposable income and raise perceived inflation, making households more pessimistic about finances and the macro outlook. A key risk is confounding from broader macro shocks (e.g., recessions, monetary tightening, geopolitical events) that both move oil prices and independently depress sentiment, as well as simultaneity if sentiment proxies expected economic activity that also predicts oil demand and prices. The researcher should check robustness to controlling for inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and recession indicators, and probe timing by using lags and/or high-frequency event-study variation around exogenous oil supply disruptions to see whether sentiment responds after oil moves rather than vice versa.",
  "cpi_to_fed_funds": "",
  "fed_funds_to_unemployment": "A higher fed funds rate co-moves with higher unemployment over subsequent quarters, consistent with the idea that tighter monetary conditions reduce aggregate demand and hiring with a lag. The main risk is that the fed funds rate is set in response to anticipated labor-market conditions (policy endogeneity), so the correlation may partly reflect the Fed reacting to forecasts of unemployment rather than unemployment responding to rates; omitted macro shocks (productivity, fiscal policy, global demand) and regime changes (ZLB/forward guidance) can also distort the relationship and lag structure. Next, the researcher should check whether the estimate is robust to using an exogenous monetary policy shock measure (e.g., high-frequency surprises or narrative shocks), alternative lag lengths, and controlling for real activity and inflation to reduce confounding from systematic policy rules.",
  "vix_to_industrial": "Higher VIX is associated with lower subsequent industrial production, consistent with the idea that elevated financial uncertainty and risk premia coincide with weaker investment, tighter financial conditions, and more cautious production decisions. A key risk is that this reduced-form link may be washed out or biased by confounding macro shocks (e.g., demand contractions, monetary policy surprises, or global stress) that move both VIX and output, as well as timing/aggregation issues if VIX spikes are short-lived relative to monthly IP. Given the imprecise, statistically insignificant estimate, the researcher should check robustness to alternative lags and horizons, control for common shocks (policy rate, credit spreads, oil prices, global activity), and test stability across regimes (crisis vs. normal times) and nonlinear effects (large VIX spikes vs. small changes).",
  "vix_to_nfci": "Higher VIX mechanically feeds into (or closely tracks) tighter financial conditions, since many NFCI-style indexes incorporate market volatility and risk premia measures that rise when VIX spikes. The main risk is tautology/overlap: the estimate may largely reflect shared construction or common measurement rather than an economically meaningful transmission channel, and any remaining movement could be jointly driven by broad risk-off shocks. Next, verify the index methodology and compute the contribution/loading of VIX (or related volatility series) to NFCI; re-estimate using an NFCI variant with volatility components removed or replaced, and check whether the relationship survives after controlling for common risk factors (e.g., credit spreads, term premium, liquidity).",
  "industrial_to_unemployment": "Higher industrial production co-moves with lower unemployment, consistent with Okun-style dynamics where expansions raise labor demand and contractions precede layoffs. A key risk is reverse timing and measurement: unemployment can also feed back into production (via demand), and both series share business-cycle shocks, policy responses, and common trends that can induce spurious correlation if not properly detrended and timed. Next, check robustness to alternative lags/leads (does production lead unemployment?), stationarity/detrending choices (levels vs growth rates), and inclusion of common-cycle controls (e.g., monetary policy, inflation, recession indicators) or a VAR/Granger-style analysis to assess directionality."
