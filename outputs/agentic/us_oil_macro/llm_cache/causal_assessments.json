  "oil_shock_to_oil_price": "**Strategy**: Reduced-form local projections estimating the contemporaneous response of oil prices to an \u201coil supply shock,\u201d relying on time-series controls/lag structure and extensive robustness/diagnostic checks rather than an explicit exogenous-shock or IV/RCT design.\n\n**Strengths**: The effect is precisely estimated (\u03b2 = -0.052, SE = 0.0055, p \u2248 9e-21) and the time-series implementation appears technically well-behaved given the passed diagnostics (HAC bandwidth/sensitivity, residual autocorrelation checks, lead tests, lag sensitivity, regime stability, and shock support), which reduces concerns that the result is a fragile specification artifact.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: The identification field is explicitly \u201cnone,\u201d so the key causal requirement\u2014exogeneity of the \u201coil supply shock\u201d with respect to contemporaneous demand/news, risk premia, or anticipatory behavior\u2014is not established; in oil markets, measured \u201csupply shocks\u201d often co-move with geopolitical and demand-related information that also moves prices, creating potential omitted-variable and simultaneity bias. Passing HAC/lead/autocorrelation diagnostics does not rule out endogeneity or violations of the structural interpretation (e.g., mismeasurement of the shock, expectation effects, or common shocks).\n\n**Verdict**: WEAK",
  "oil_to_cpi_headline": "**Strategy**: Local projections of headline CPI responses to oil price movements, relying on time-series reduced-form dynamics without an explicit source of exogenous oil price variation.\n\n**Strengths**: The pass of multiple time-series diagnostics (HAC bandwidth adequacy, effective observations, leads/placebo-style test, residual autocorrelation checks, and sensitivity to HAC/lags) supports that the estimated impulse responses are not driven by obvious specification artifacts. The \u201cshock support\u201d and sign-consistency checks suggest the oil price series has sufficient variation and the estimated response is not erratic across horizons.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: The identification is fundamentally not causal as stated: with \u201cType: none,\u201d oil prices are endogenous to macro conditions that also move CPI (global demand, monetary policy, supply disruptions correlated with broader conditions), so the LP coefficient is a correlation of joint equilibrium movements unless an exogenous oil shock is isolated. The failed **ts_regime_stability** diagnostic indicates structural breaks/time variation (e.g., changes in pass-through, inflation regimes), which can invalidate a single reduced-form mapping from oil to CPI and undermines transportability of the estimate; moreover the estimate is statistically null (p\u22480.94), offering no empirical support for a stable effect in this specification.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "oil_to_cpi_core": "**Strategy**: Reduced-form local projections of core CPI on oil price shocks/changes with HAC inference and time-series stability checks, but with no explicit exogenous-shock or quasi-experimental identification.\n\n**Strengths**: Many time-series diagnostics reportedly pass (HAC sensitivity, lag sensitivity, regime stability, residual autocorrelation checks), which supports that the estimated relationship (0.0023, p\u22480.01) is not purely an artifact of a particular bandwidth/lag/specification. The \u201csmaller and slower\u201d pass-through narrative is economically plausible for core inflation.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: The strategy is explicitly \u201cnone\u201d for identification, so oil prices are likely endogenous to macro conditions that also move core inflation (global demand, monetary policy responses, risk shocks), implying omitted-variable and reverse-causality concerns. The failed leads test is a red flag for pre-trends/anticipation or model misspecification\u2014if future oil changes predict today\u2019s core CPI, the shock is not behaving as exogenous in the LP setup, undermining a causal interpretation.\n\n**Verdict**: ABSENT",
  "oil_to_industrial": "**Strategy**: Local projections estimate the dynamic association between oil-price changes and industrial production, but no explicit exogenous shock/IV/narrative identification is provided.\n\n**Strengths**: The time-series diagnostics you list mostly pass (HAC bandwidth adequacy, effective observations, residual autocorrelation checks, HAC/lag sensitivity, regime stability, and shock support), which supports that the LP specification is statistically stable rather than purely driven by a fragile choice of lags or covariance estimator. The proposed mechanism (input-cost \u201cHamilton channel\u201d) is economically coherent and aligns with prior literature.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: Identification is effectively absent: oil prices are plausibly endogenous to global demand and contemporaneous macro conditions that also move industrial production, so the LP coefficient can reflect reverse causality and omitted variables (e.g., world activity, monetary policy, geopolitical shocks affecting both oil and output). The failed **ts_leads_test** is a red flag for pre-trends/anticipation or residual predictability (i.e., industrial production \u201cresponding\u201d before the oil-price movement), directly weakening a causal interpretation even if other stability diagnostics pass; additionally, the estimate is only marginally significant (p\u22480.066), consistent with sensitivity to specification or sampling variation.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "oil_to_vix": "**Strategy**: Reduced-form local projections relating oil-price shocks/movements to subsequent VIX responses, but with **no stated source of exogenous variation** (no IV, no narrative shocks, no quasi-experiment).\n\n**Strengths**: The estimate is statistically precise (\u22120.53, SE 0.16, p\u22480.0007) and a number of time-series robustness checks pass (HAC bandwidth/sensitivity, lag sensitivity, residual autocorrelation tests, leads test, sign consistency, and shock support), which supports that the relationship is not a mechanical artifact of one specific specification.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: With \u201cType: none,\u201d the design does not rule out **simultaneity and omitted global factors** (e.g., global demand news, geopolitical risk, broad risk-off episodes) that can move both oil prices and VIX, so the edge is not causally identified. The failure of **regime stability** is a major concern: it suggests the oil\u2013VIX relationship changes across subsamples/market regimes, undermining external validity and raising the possibility that the estimate is driven by particular crisis periods rather than a stable causal effect.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "oil_to_sentiment": "**Strategy**: No explicit identification strategy is provided; the edge relies on an informal reduced-form association between oil/gasoline prices and consumer sentiment.\n\n**Strengths**: The claim is economically plausible and consistent with a direct household budget channel (gasoline as a salient, frequent purchase) that could move sentiment contemporaneously. If the relationship were shown to be robust across time, regions, and alternative sentiment measures with appropriate controls, that would support the mechanism\u2014but none of that is documented here.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: Oil prices are highly endogenous to macroeconomic conditions (global demand, recession risk, monetary policy expectations, geopolitical shocks) that also directly affect consumer sentiment, creating severe omitted-variable bias and reverse/bi-directional causality (e.g., macro news jointly moves oil and sentiment). Without a design (e.g., exogenous oil supply shocks, an IV, local price pass-through with fixed effects, event studies around plausibly exogenous disruptions) and diagnostics (pre-trends, balance, first-stage strength, exclusion restrictions), the causal direction and magnitude are not identified.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "cpi_to_fed_funds": "**Strategy**: No causal identification\u2014this is a reduced-form local-projections association intended to describe comovement in a \u201creaction function\u201d setting, not to isolate exogenous variation in inflation.\n\n**Strengths**: The time-series diagnostics largely pass (HAC bandwidth/effective observations, residual autocorrelation checks, leads test, regime stability, HAC sensitivity, shock support), which supports basic model adequacy for describing correlations and dynamic responses in-sample. The framing (\u201cFed raises rates in response to inflation\u201d) is institutionally plausible as a narrative.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: With \u201cType: none,\u201d there is no source of exogenous variation in CPI, so reverse causality (policy affects inflation) and omitted variables (e.g., output gap, financial conditions, supply shocks, expectations) can drive the estimate; in a monetary policy context, simultaneity is first-order. The effect is statistically indistinguishable from zero (p=0.775; SE large relative to estimate), and the failed lag sensitivity diagnostic indicates the estimated response is not robust to reasonable lag-specification changes\u2014further undermining any causal interpretation.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "fed_funds_to_unemployment": "**Strategy**: Local projections estimate the dynamic association between changes in the fed funds rate and future unemployment, but no explicit exogenous shock/IV/RCT-style source of variation is specified.\n\n**Strengths**: The time-series diagnostics you report (HAC bandwidth/robustness, residual autocorrelation checks, lead tests, lag/HAC sensitivity, regime stability, and shock support) support that the estimated impulse-response pattern is statistically stable and not obviously driven by mechanical serial correlation or arbitrary specification choices. The effect is precisely estimated (p\u22480.0075), and \u201csign consistency\u201d/stability checks increase confidence in the *descriptive* dynamic relationship.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: With \u201cIdentification strategy: none,\u201d the fed funds rate is likely endogenous to macro conditions and expectations (policy reacts to labor-market and inflation forecasts), so reverse causality and omitted-variable bias remain central threats; standard LP diagnostics do not solve policy endogeneity. Without an identified monetary policy shock (e.g., high-frequency surprises, narrative shocks, or a validated IV) and without explicit controls/structure guaranteeing sequential exogeneity, the estimate cannot be interpreted as a causal effect of tightening on unemployment.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "vix_to_industrial": "**Strategy**: None\u2014this is a reduced-form local projections association of industrial production on VIX with no exogenous shock, instrument, or quasi-experimental variation.\n\n**Strengths**: The time-series diagnostics you list (HAC bandwidth/effective obs, residual autocorrelation checks, HAC/lag sensitivity, regime stability, shock support, sign consistency) support that the *time-series specification is not obviously fragile* to standard implementation choices. The estimate is also statistically indistinguishable from zero (p\u22480.59), which reduces concern about overstating a large causal effect from noisy correlations.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: With \u201cType: none,\u201d the VIX is highly likely endogenous to macro conditions (reverse causality from industrial production expectations to VIX, and omitted common shocks like monetary policy, global risk, or news), so the edge is not causally identified. The failed **ts_leads_test** is an additional red flag: detectable lead effects are consistent with anticipation/simultaneity or pre-trends, directly undermining a causal interpretation even within the reduced-form LP framework.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "vix_to_nfci": "**Strategy**: No causal identification is provided; the local projections estimate is treated as a time-series association between two tightly related financial stress indices (near-mechanical linkage).\n\n**Strengths**: Several time-series robustness checks pass (HAC bandwidth adequacy, effective sample size, residual autocorrelation handling, HAC/lag sensitivity, regime stability, and \u201cshock support\u201d), and the effect is statistically strong (0.75, SE 0.23, p\u22480.001), consistent with contemporaneous co-movement. The \u201cmechanical\u201d edge type plus the note that VIX is a component/correlate of financial conditions makes the positive association unsurprising and stable.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: With \u201cType: none,\u201d there is no exogenous variation\u2014VIX and NFCI likely share common drivers (risk appetite, monetary/credit shocks) and may embed overlapping information, so the coefficient can reflect simultaneity/common-factor measurement rather than a causal effect of VIX on broader conditions. The failed **ts_leads_test** is a direct red flag for causal ordering/exogeneity in LPs (e.g., evidence consistent with anticipation, reverse causality, or omitted dynamics), undermining the interpretation of the LP impulse as a causal shock transmission.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "industrial_to_unemployment": "**Strategy**: No causal identification is claimed or implemented; this is a reduced-form time-series local-projections association between industrial production movements and subsequent unemployment.\n\n**Strengths**: The LOCAL_PROJECTIONS setup with extensive time-series diagnostics passed (HAC bandwidth adequacy, residual autocorrelation checks, lead tests, lag/HAC sensitivity, regime stability, and sign consistency) supports that the estimated dynamic relationship is statistically and temporally stable in-sample (estimate \u221229.0, SE 12.8, p=0.023). The \u201cts_leads_test\u201d passing is consistent with (though not proof of) limited reverse-timing from unemployment innovations to prior industrial production within the tested horizons.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: Without an exogenous shock, IV, RDD, or randomized variation, the edge is vulnerable to omitted macro shocks (monetary/fiscal policy, financial conditions, demand shocks, productivity shocks) that jointly move output and unemployment, so the coefficient generally mixes multiple structural channels rather than isolating \\( \\text{IP} \\rightarrow \\text{Unemp} \\). Okun\u2019s law provides a descriptive regularity, but it does not establish the key exogeneity assumption needed for causal interpretation; passing time-series diagnostics does not rule out confounding or simultaneity driven by common shocks.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**"
