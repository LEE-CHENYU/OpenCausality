  "kzt_usd_to_cpi_tradable": "**Strategy**: Reduced-form local projections estimating the dynamic association between KZT/USD movements and tradable CPI, with extensive time-series robustness/diagnostic checks but no explicit exogenous shock/IV/RCT identification.\n\n**Strengths**: The LP design with HAC inference and multiple stability/sensitivity diagnostics (bandwidth, lag/HAC sensitivity, regime stability, residual autocorrelation, leads test) supports that the estimated pass-through pattern is not an artifact of serial correlation, specification choice, or unstable regimes. The \u201cshock support\u201d and \u201csign consistency\u201d checks add credibility that the measured response is systematic in the data and not driven by a narrow subset of episodes.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: Without an identification strategy for exchange-rate innovations (e.g., external instrument, high-frequency monetary surprise, commodity-driven terms-of-trade shock, or policy discontinuity), the KZT/USD change is likely endogenous to inflation news, monetary policy reactions, risk premia, and demand/supply shocks that also affect tradable prices, violating causal interpretation. Passing time-series diagnostics does not address omitted variable bias or simultaneity; the marginal significance (p\u22480.079) further suggests the estimate may be sensitive to remaining endogeneity or sampling variation.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "kzt_usd_to_cpi_nontradable": "**Strategy**: Reduced-form local projections estimating the dynamic response of non-tradable CPI to KZT/USD movements, relying on time-series robustness diagnostics rather than a source of exogenous variation.\n\n**Strengths**: A broad set of time-series diagnostics passes (residual autocorrelation checks, leads test, HAC sensitivity/bandwidth, lag sensitivity, regime stability, shock support), which supports internal validity of the *forecasting* relationship and reduces concerns that results are an artifact of specification, serial correlation, or unstable regimes. The estimate is statistically different from zero (p\u22480.023) but economically tiny, aligning with the stated falsification expectation (\u201cnear-zero pass-through\u201d to non-tradables).\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: There is explicitly no identification strategy (no IV, no natural experiment, no structural shock isolation), so KZT/USD is likely endogenous to domestic inflation conditions, monetary policy reactions, and common shocks (e.g., commodity prices), all of which can confound the edge. Even with leads tests and stability checks, reduced-form LPs do not rule out omitted time-varying confounders or simultaneity (exchange rate and prices co-moving due to shared drivers), so the causal interpretation is not secured.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "imported_inflation_instrument_to_real_income": "**Strategy**: No explicit identification strategy is provided; the edge is asserted based on an economic narrative that exchange-rate\u2013driven imported inflation reduces households\u2019 purchasing power and thus real income.\n\n**Strengths**: The proposed direction is economically coherent (higher consumer prices mechanically reduce real purchasing power holding nominal income fixed), and the \u201cimported inflation\u201d construct plausibly targets an external price component rather than purely domestic demand-driven inflation.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: Without a design (e.g., IV, natural experiment, or quasi-exogenous shock) this is vulnerable to endogeneity and omitted variables: exchange-rate depreciation and imported inflation can coincide with broader macro shocks (recessions, wage dynamics, policy responses) that also directly affect real income. The term \u201cinstrument\u201d suggests IV use, but no first-stage/weak-IV diagnostics, exclusion restriction argument, or falsification/placebo tests are provided, so the causal pathway is not empirically isolated.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "cpi_headline_to_real_income": "**Strategy**: Local projections estimate the reduced-form dynamic association of headline CPI with subsequent real income, but no exogenous source of variation (shock/IV/RDD/RCT) is specified.\n\n**Strengths**: Passing HAC bandwidth/sensitivity and regime-stability diagnostics suggests inference is not overly sensitive to reasonable time-series HAC choices and that coefficients are not obviously driven by a single regime break. A reduced-form LP is an appropriate descriptive tool for tracing dynamics if the identifying shock were credibly exogenous.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: With \u201cType: none,\u201d CPI movements are endogenous to macro conditions that also move real income (business cycle, monetary policy responses, demand shocks), so reverse causality and omitted-variable bias are first-order concerns; without a shock-based identification (e.g., external/imported inflation instrument, narrative shocks, high-frequency surprises), the edge is not causally pinned down. The failed **effective_obs** diagnostic further weakens credibility because small effective sample size (especially under serial correlation) can make HAC-based significance and stability checks unreliable; additionally, the reported estimate/SE of 0.0 provides no evidentiary content.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "imported_inflation_instrument_to_real_expenditure_negative": "**Strategy**: No identification strategy is provided; the edge asserts a negative causal effect of imported inflation on real expenditure based on narrative economic reasoning (sticky nominal incomes).\n\n**Strengths**: The sign is theoretically coherent: if nominal incomes are sticky in the short run, higher import prices raise the cost of consumption baskets and can reduce real purchasing power and real consumption. This mechanism is consistent with standard real-income/terms-of-trade channels in open-economy macro.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: Without an exogenous source of variation in \u201cimported inflation,\u201d the relationship is highly confounded (e.g., global demand shocks, domestic monetary/fiscal responses, exchange-rate movements, and simultaneous recession dynamics can move both inflation and real spending). Reverse causality is also plausible: domestic demand conditions can affect exchange rates, pass-through, and measured import prices, and policy reactions can jointly determine inflation and consumption.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "transfer_income_to_nominal_income_buffering": "**Strategy**: Reduced-form local projections relating transfer income to nominal income dynamics, but with no stated source of exogenous variation (no shock/IV/RDD/RCT), so the edge rests on time-series association with HAC-based inference and stability checks.\n\n**Strengths**: Passing HAC bandwidth/sensitivity and regime-stability diagnostics suggests the estimated relationship is not purely an artifact of a particular lag/HAC choice or a single subsample regime. \u201cSign consistency\u201d (if genuinely pre-specified and not data-mined) provides some limited robustness against overfitting.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: With identification explicitly listed as \u201cnone,\u201d the estimate is highly vulnerable to simultaneity and omitted variables (e.g., macro shocks that jointly move transfers and nominal income; policy reacting to income declines), plus reverse causality (transfers increasing when nominal income falls). The key failed diagnostic\u2014**effective_obs**\u2014directly undermines inferential credibility (likely too few effective observations due to autocorrelation/lag structure), and the reported estimate/SE of **0.0/0.0** with p=None is a red flag for estimation/recording issues that makes any causal interpretation untenable.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "real_income_to_cor_kspi": "**Strategy**: Reduced-form local projections of `cor_kspi` on innovations in `real_income`, relying on time-series dynamics/HAC inference rather than any explicit source of exogenous variation.\n\n**Strengths**: The diagnostics that did pass (HAC bandwidth choice, HAC sensitivity, regime stability, and sign consistency) suggest the time-series specification is not overly sensitive to standard inference/tuning choices and is not obviously driven by a single regime break. The hypothesized mechanism (income squeeze \u2192 repayment stress/provisions \u2192 balance-sheet pressure) is economically coherent.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: Identification is essentially absent because the design explicitly lists \u201cType: none\u201d: real income movements are endogenous to macro/financial conditions that also directly affect Kaspi outcomes (simultaneity, omitted common shocks like monetary policy, commodity prices, FX/inflation surprises). The failed `effective_obs` diagnostic indicates insufficient effective sample size for reliable LP impulse estimates; combined with an estimate/SE reported as 0.0 and no p-value, the result is not empirically interpretable and could reflect estimation breakdown or data/standardization issues rather than a true null effect.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "vix_shock_to_deposit_cost_kspi": "**Strategy**: Reduced-form local projections of Kaspi deposit funding costs on a \u201cVIX shock,\u201d effectively treating innovations in VIX as an exogenous global risk-off shock with dynamic responses estimated via HAC-robust inference.\n\n**Strengths**: VIX is plausibly external to a single bank\u2019s deposit pricing in Kazakhstan and can proxy for global financial conditions, which supports a direction of influence. Several time-series diagnostics pass (HAC bandwidth/implementation, residual autocorrelation test, leads test, HAC sensitivity, and shock support), which reduces concerns about mechanical inference problems and obvious pre-trends.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: The design lists no explicit identification strategy, so exogeneity is assumed rather than established; VIX innovations can be correlated with other concurrent global/regional shocks (commodity prices, FX/rate moves, Kazakhstan risk premium) that also affect deposit costs, creating omitted-variable bias. Two key stability checks fail (lag sensitivity and regime stability), indicating the impulse estimates are not robust to model specification and may differ across regimes; combined with an imprecise and statistically insignificant estimate (p\u22480.70), this weakens causal interpretability.\n\n**Verdict**: WEAK",
  "vix_shock_to_ppop_kspi": "**Strategy**: Reduced-form local projections estimating the dynamic response of `ppop_kspi` to a measured `vix_shock`, relying on the shock being effectively exogenous, but with no explicit identification (no IV, no narrative/external instrument, no quasi-experimental design).\n\n**Strengths**: Several time-series diagnostics passed (leads test, residual autocorrelation checks, HAC sensitivity, lag sensitivity, regime stability, and shock support), which supports that the estimated impulse response is not an artifact of a particular lag/HAC choice or obvious pre-trends. The sign consistency diagnostic and shock support suggest the series reacts in a directionally stable way and that there is variation in the shock over the sample.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: The identification is fundamentally not established: VIX innovations can be correlated with contemporaneous global/macroeconomic news that also affects Kaspi\u2019s interest/profit margins (omitted variables/common shocks), so the reduced-form coefficient cannot be interpreted as causal without a defensible exogeneity argument. The key failure\u2014`effective_obs`\u2014raises concerns about small effective sample size (especially after lags/leads), making inference fragile; coupled with only marginal statistical significance (p \u2248 0.091), this weakens credibility and makes results sensitive to specification and finite-sample distortions.\n\n**Verdict**: ABSENT",
  "ppop_kspi_to_total_capital_kspi": "**Strategy**: No causal identification strategy is provided; the LOCAL_PROJECTIONS estimate is an associational time-series projection that may reflect accounting linkages rather than exogenous variation.\n\n**Strengths**: The edge is labeled \u201cmechanical,\u201d which can be appropriate if `ppop_kspi` is an accounting component that directly enters the construction of `total_capital_kspi` (e.g., profits flowing into retained earnings and thus regulatory capital), making the direction plausible. The estimate is precise (p\u22482e-16) and several time-series robustness diagnostics pass (HAC bandwidth choice, residual autocorrelation checks, HAC/lag sensitivity, regime stability, shock support, sign consistency), which supports statistical stability of the projection.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: \u201cType: none\u201d means there is no exogenous shock, IV, discontinuity, or experimental variation isolating variation in `ppop_kspi`; thus the coefficient can be driven by common shocks (macro/credit cycle), simultaneous determination, or omitted variables affecting both profits/provisions and capital management. Two key diagnostics fail\u2014**effective_obs** (suggesting small effective sample / low independent information due to persistence) and **ts_leads_test** (failed pre-trend/lead test, implying anticipatory effects or reverse causality), both of which directly undermine causal timing and invalidate a causal interpretation even if the association is stable.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "rwa_kspi_to_k2_ratio_kspi": "**Strategy**: No causal identification\u2014this is a mechanical/accounting relationship where changes in RWA mechanically move the capital ratio \\(K2 = \\frac{\\text{Total Capital}}{\\text{RWA}}\\) holding the numerator fixed.\n\n**Strengths**: The sign and magnitude are directionally consistent with the identity (higher RWA lowers the ratio), and the result is statistically precise with extensive time-series robustness checks (HAC bandwidth, lag/HAC sensitivity, regime stability) passing.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: Because the edge is an identity, the regression does not isolate an exogenous \u201cshock\u201d to RWA; movements in RWA are typically jointly determined with capital management and risk-taking, and the failed leads test flags predictive dynamics/incomplete shock isolation inconsistent with a clean local-projection causal shock. Any interpretation beyond arithmetic (e.g., \u201cRWA increases cause lower capital adequacy in a behavioral sense\u201d) is invalid without an external instrument or quasi-experiment.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "real_expenditure_to_ppop_kspi": "**Strategy**: Local projections are used to trace the reduced-form dynamic response of `ppop_kspi` to variation in `real_expenditure`, but no exogenous shock/IV/RCT-style source of variation is specified (effectively a time-series association).\n\n**Strengths**: Passing HAC bandwidth selection and HAC sensitivity checks suggests inference is at least robust to some choices of heteroskedasticity/autocorrelation correction. Regime-stability and sign-consistency diagnostics provide limited reassurance that the estimated relationship is not purely driven by a single subsample or a sign flip across specifications.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: With \u201cType: none\u201d for identification, the key threat is endogeneity: `real_expenditure` likely responds contemporaneously to financial-sector conditions embedded in `ppop_kspi` (reverse causality) and to common macro shocks (omitted variables), so the LP coefficient is not interpretable as causal. Multiple failed diagnostics\u2014especially residual autocorrelation, lag sensitivity, shock support, and effective observations\u2014directly undermine internal validity (mis-specified dynamics, insufficient usable variation, and unstable impulse estimates), and the implausibly tiny SE relative to the point estimate is a red flag for numerical/estimation issues or unaccounted dependence.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "kzt_usd_to_imported_inflation_instrument": "**Strategy**: No causal identification is being claimed; this is an identity/construct edge where `imported_inflation_instrument` is mechanically derived from `kzt_usd` (auto-created from the IV construction).\n\n**Strengths**: If the instrument variable is explicitly defined as a deterministic function of `kzt_usd` (e.g., the FX rate itself or a component used in its calculation), then the relationship is tautologically true and does not require econometric identification.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: This edge provides zero evidence that `kzt_usd` is exogenous with respect to the downstream outcome; any endogeneity of FX (policy responses, commodity shocks, capital flows) directly carries into the constructed instrument. If the \u201cidentity\u201d mapping is not exact (e.g., additional data sources, lags, transformations, or revisions), measurement error or undocumented processing could break the supposed determinism.\n\n**Verdict**: ABSENT",
  "e_import_share_to_imported_inflation_instrument": "**Strategy**: This edge is defined by an accounting identity: the \u201cimported_inflation_instrument\u201d is mechanically constructed as \\( \\Delta \\log(kzt\\_usd)\\times E\\_import\\_share\\), so \\(E\\_import\\_share\\) deterministically maps into the instrument.\n\n**Strengths**: Because it is a deterministic construction, there is no statistical identification problem for this mapping itself\u2014given the formula, changes in \\(E\\_import\\_share\\) translate one-for-one into the computed instrument holding the exchange-rate term fixed. Using *pre-period* import shares can reduce simultaneity with contemporaneous shocks (i.e., avoids using endogenous current shares).\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: This is not a causal relationship in the econometric sense; it\u2019s a definition, so it does not provide exogenous variation or a testable exclusion restriction relevant for downstream causal claims. If \u201cpre-period\u201d shares are not truly predetermined (e.g., influenced by anticipatory behavior, policy, or earlier trends correlated with outcomes), then even the intended interpretation of the instrument as exogenous \u201cexposure\u201d can be compromised in subsequent stages.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "total_capital_kspi_to_k2_ratio_kspi": "**Strategy**: Uses an accounting/regulatory identity (K2 ratio is defined as Total Capital divided by RWA), treating the edge as mechanically implied rather than causally estimated.\n\n**Strengths**: The mapping from Total Capital to the K2 ratio is structurally grounded in the Basel/regulatory definition, so directionality is not a behavioral causal claim but a definitional relationship. Several time-series diagnostics (HAC bandwidth/robustness, effective observations, residual autocorrelation checks, shock support) suggest the LP implementation is not obviously driven by basic inference artifacts.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: The empirical LP estimate is essentially null and very imprecise (\u22120.0053, SE 0.0157, p=0.74), which is inconsistent with a stable mechanical relationship unless RWA moves endogenously in ways that offset capital changes; that means the \u201ceffect\u201d of capital on the ratio is not identified without modeling/conditioning on RWA. Diagnostics failing on leads, lag sensitivity, and regime stability directly undermine the key assumption that the definitional mapping is stable over time and that the dynamic specification is correctly capturing the identity (suggesting structural breaks, changing measurement, or shifting regulatory/reporting regimes).\n\n**Verdict**: WEAK",
  "nominal_expenditure_to_real_expenditure": "**Strategy**: Treat the edge as an accounting/measurement identity: real_expenditure is mechanically constructed from nominal_expenditure (deflated by CPI), so the mapping is definitional rather than estimated causal variation.\n\n**Strengths**: Because real_expenditure is computed directly from nominal_expenditure (and CPI), there is no confounding in the usual sense\u2014changes in nominal_expenditure translate one-for-one into changes in the constructed real measure holding the deflator fixed. The \u201cestimate 0.0 (SE 0.0)\u201d is consistent with this being a formula component rather than an econometric relationship, and standard LP diagnostics (HAC bandwidth, stability/sensitivity checks) are largely irrelevant to identification of a definitional link.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: The key threat is mismeasurement/construct validity: CPI_headline may be an inappropriate deflator for household consumption (substitution bias, quality adjustment, household-specific inflation, mismatch with the consumption basket), which would make \u201creal_expenditure\u201d a noisy or biased proxy for true real consumption. The failed **effective_obs** diagnostic raises concerns about whether the time-series setup has enough usable variation/observations for the LP machinery, but more importantly it underscores that statistical inference here doesn\u2019t meaningfully validate the identity.\n\n**Verdict**: MODERATE",

As an \u201cidentity\u201d relation, a contemporaneous link could be conceptually grounded if real expenditure is constructed using CPI (deflation), but that would be a definitional mapping rather than an estimated causal effect.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: With \u201cType: none\u201d and no identifying assumption, the LP coefficient is purely associational and vulnerable to simultaneity (expenditure can affect prices), omitted variables (aggregate demand/supply shocks moving both), and policy responses. Two key robustness checks fail\u2014lag sensitivity and regime stability\u2014indicating the estimate is not stable to specification/period changes; combined with an imprecise, insignificant estimate (0.87 with SE 1.89, p=0.65), this undermines any causal interpretation.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "nominal_income_to_real_income": "**Strategy**: This edge is an accounting/definitional identity (real income is mechanically derived from nominal income and a price deflator), not a causally identified effect using exogenous variation.\n\n**Strengths**: As an identity, the direction and sign are structurally implied by the construction of the variables, and the estimate is extremely precise (SE \u2248 0.028, p \u2248 0). Many time-series diagnostics (HAC bandwidth adequacy, effective observations, residual autocorrelation checks, HAC/lag sensitivity, regime stability, and shock support) suggest the local-projection fit is statistically stable.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: There is no identification design (no experiment/quasi-experiment/IV), so the coefficient cannot be interpreted as a causal response of \u201creal income\u201d to an exogenous change in \u201cnominal income\u201d holding the deflator fixed\u2014real income is jointly determined by nominal income and prices. The failed **ts_leads_test** indicates evidence consistent with anticipation/reverse timing (future nominal income predicting current real income), which is a red flag for interpreting the LP estimate as a causal impulse response even if one were attempted.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",

The failed **ts_leads_test** is a red flag for reverse timing/anticipation (headline moving before \u201cnon-tradable\u201d in the LP), inconsistent with a clean causal ordering and suggestive of simultaneity/common shocks or measurement/aggregation issues.\n\n**Verdict**: **ABSENT**",
  "cpi_tradable_to_cpi_headline": "**Strategy**: None\u2014this edge is auto-bridged via tag similarity and then estimated with local projections, so it amounts to a predictive association rather than an identified causal effect (despite being labeled \u201cidentity\u201d).\n\n**Strengths**: The LP estimate is very precise (0.762, SE 0.043, extremely small p-value) and many time-series robustness checks pass (HAC bandwidth/effective obs, residual autocorrelation check, HAC/lag sensitivity, regime stability, shock support, sign consistency), suggesting the relationship is stable and not an artifact of a particular specification.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**: There is no source of exogenous variation and no stated identifying assumption; headline CPI mechanically co-moves with tradable CPI through index construction and shared shocks, so the coefficient is not interpretable as a causal effect without a structural decomposition/weighting identity.
