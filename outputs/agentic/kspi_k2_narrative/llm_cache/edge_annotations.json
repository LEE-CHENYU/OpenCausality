  "kzt_usd_to_cpi_tradable": "A depreciation of the KZT against the USD is associated with higher tradable CPI, consistent with exchange-rate pass-through raising local-currency prices of imported and import-competing goods; the reported magnitude corresponds to roughly 11.3% pass-through under the study\u2019s scaling. The main risks are omitted shocks that move both the exchange rate and tradable inflation (e.g., commodity-price or monetary-policy news), reverse timing/anticipation (prices adjusting before observed FX moves), and measurement/composition changes in the tradables basket. Next, check robustness to adding global controls (oil, global inflation, USD index), alternative lags and local-projection horizons, and whether pass-through is state-dependent (large vs small FX moves) and stable across subsamples/regimes.",
  "kzt_usd_to_cpi_nontradable": "A depreciation of the KZT against the USD is associated with a small increase in Kazakhstan\u2019s non-tradable CPI, which is a useful falsification check because true non-tradables should exhibit near-zero exchange-rate pass-through absent broad macro spillovers. The key risk is that this reduced-form link reflects omitted aggregate forces (monetary/fiscal tightening, demand shocks, wage indexation, administered price adjustments, or measurement/classification errors where \u201cnon-tradables\u201d include imported inputs) rather than exchange-rate transmission per se, and the statistically significant but tiny estimate could still be economically negligible. Next, the researcher should check robustness to controls for domestic demand and policy (interest rates, output gap, wages, regulated tariffs), alternative definitions/weights of non-tradables, and dynamic specifications (lags, local projections) to see whether the association is stable and not driven by specific episodes (e.g., devaluation windows).",
  "imported_inflation_instrument_to_real_income": "Imported inflation induced by exchange-rate depreciation causes real income to fall by reducing households\u2019 purchasing power: nominal wages and transfers typically adjust sluggishly while the prices of imported consumption goods and imported inputs (passed through into domestic prices) rise. The key risk is that exchange-rate depreciations often coincide with broader macro shocks\u2014monetary tightening, capital-flow reversals, financial distress, or terms-of-trade changes\u2014that directly affect real income, violating the exclusion restriction and making the instrument reflect more than \u201cpure\u201d imported inflation; heterogeneity in pass-through and consumption baskets can also blur the mapping from the instrument to households\u2019 effective inflation. Next, the researcher should test instrument relevance (first-stage pass-through to CPI components), probe exclusion via placebo outcomes and controls for concurrent macro/financial shocks, and check robustness across groups with different import shares (e.g., high vs. low imported-consumption exposure) to see if the implied channel matches the data.",
  "cpi_headline_to_real_income": "Higher headline CPI inflation is associated with lower real income because prices rise faster than nominal wages and transfers adjust, compressing households\u2019 purchasing power, especially when imported inflation feeds through quickly to consumer baskets. The main risk is that this reduced-form relationship may be confounded by simultaneous macro shocks (e.g., recessions, exchange-rate moves, monetary tightening) that both raise measured CPI and depress incomes, as well as mechanical issues from how \u201creal income\u201d is deflated (common deflator bias) or compositional changes in the price index. A researcher should next check timing and pass-through\u2014e.g., whether CPI leads real income in an event-study or distributed-lag setup\u2014and test robustness to alternative deflators (core CPI, PCE, region-specific CPI) and controls for exchange rates, unemployment, and policy rates.",
  "imported_inflation_instrument_to_real_expenditure_negative": "This edge represents the idea that an exogenous rise in imported inflation raises the prices of tradable consumption goods, and with nominal incomes adjusting sluggishly, households\u2019 real purchasing power falls, leading to lower real expenditure. The main risks are that the \u201cimported inflation\u201d instrument may not be truly exogenous\u2014e.g., it could proxy for domestic demand conditions, exchange-rate movements tied to local shocks, or policy responses that independently affect consumption\u2014creating omitted-variable bias. A researcher should check instrument relevance and exogeneity by documenting the pass-through to consumer prices, showing weak/limited correlation with domestic activity and policy shocks, and running placebo/balance tests (e.g., pre-trends, effects on clearly non-tradable components) to support the exclusion restriction.",
  "transfer_income_to_nominal_income_buffering": "Higher transfer income is associated with higher (or more stable) nominal income, capturing the idea that government benefits, remittances, or other transfers can buffer households\u2019 cash resources when wages or self-employment earnings are hit by an exchange-rate/price shock. The main risk is that transfers are typically targeted or responsive\u2014areas/households with falling nominal incomes may receive more transfers\u2014creating reverse causality and confounding from unobserved need, eligibility rules, or local economic conditions that also affect nominal income. A researcher should check the institutional assignment mechanism and timing (e.g., pre-announced eligibility thresholds, payment lags), test for pre-trends and simultaneity, and examine heterogeneity by eligibility status or exposure to the shock to see whether the transfer\u2013income co-movement is consistent with buffering rather than targeting.",
  "real_income_to_cor_kspi": "Higher real income is associated with lower household repayment stress and a stronger consumer-credit environment, so it should co-move with Kaspi\u2019s credit-risk outcomes (and thus its stock return, `cor_kspi`), with the sign depending on whether `cor_kspi` is coded as \u201cstress/pressure\u201d versus \u201cperformance.\u201d The main risk is that both real income and `cor_kspi` are jointly driven by broader macro/financial conditions (policy rates, inflation shocks, commodity terms-of-trade, exchange rate moves) or that the income measure is noisy and timing-mismatched, making the reduced-form association unstable or attenuated. A researcher should verify the variable definition and sign, test lags/leads (income typically affects delinquencies/provisions with delay), and add core macro controls or fixed effects to see whether the association survives and whether it operates through credit-risk channels (NPLs, cost of risk, provisions) rather than contemporaneous market sentiment.",
  "vix_shock_to_deposit_cost_kspi": "",
  "vix_shock_to_ppop_kspi": "",
  "ppop_kspi_to_total_capital_kspi": "Higher `ppop_kspi` (pre-provision operating profit) may be related to higher `total_capital_kspi` because operating profits can be retained and added to equity, and because provisioning dynamics can flow through accounting into regulatory capital measures, mechanically lifting the capital numerator (\u201ccapital headroom\u201d). A key risk is that the link is partly definitional or timing-driven (same reporting period accounting mappings), so the estimate may reflect balance-sheet identities rather than an economic response; it can also be invalidated by simultaneous shocks (macro conditions, asset quality, risk-weight changes) that move both profits and measured capital. Next, verify the accounting/regulatory mapping (which capital components incorporate current-period earnings and provisions, and with what lags), then re-estimate using lagged `ppop_kspi` (and/or excluding current-year profit from capital) and controlling for RWA/asset growth to see whether the association persists beyond mechanical aggregation.",
  "rwa_kspi_to_k2_ratio_kspi": "This edge reflects the mechanical denominator effect in the capital ratio definition: holding total capital fixed, higher risk\u2011weighted assets (RWA) mechanically lower the K2 ratio (Total Capital/RWA). The main risk is interpreting the coefficient as an economic \u201ceffect\u201d rather than an identity; additionally, simultaneity can arise because banks actively manage both capital and RWA, and measurement/definition changes in RWA can induce spurious movement in the ratio. Next, the researcher should verify the ratio is computed consistently from the same accounting sources and period, and check robustness by decomposing changes in K2 into numerator (capital) versus denominator (RWA) movements to confirm the estimate aligns with purely mechanical arithmetic.",
  "real_expenditure_to_ppop_kspi": "Higher real consumer expenditure is associated with changes in ppop_kspi, consistent with the idea that resilient spending supports non-bank operating revenues and dividend capacity within holding companies. A key risk is that both spending and ppop_kspi are jointly driven by macro conditions (e.g., employment, interest rates, asset prices) or reverse channels where financial-sector profitability affects credit availability and thus spending, so the reduced-form coefficient may not isolate a spending-to-profits pathway. The extremely large-magnitude estimate with an essentially zero SE is a red flag for scaling, deterministic construction, or a mechanical link (e.g., shared deflators, trending series, or near-identity transformations). Next, verify variable definitions/units and time aggregation, check stationarity and whether the result is driven by trends or common shocks (include macro controls, time fixed effects, and lags), and run robustness with log/percent changes and alternative specifications to see if the sign and magnitude persist.",
  "kzt_usd_to_imported_inflation_instrument": "Movements in the KZT/USD exchange rate mechanically feed into the construction of the imported-inflation instrument (e.g., via the local-currency price of imported goods), so the instrument co-moves with KZT depreciation/appreciation by design. The main risk is that this \u201cidentity\u201d link embeds channels other than imported-price pass-through\u2014such as policy reactions, capital-flow shocks, or commodity-price co-movements that also move KZT/USD\u2014so the instrument may inherit endogeneity rather than isolate exogenous import-cost variation. A researcher should verify the instrument formula and weights, check how sensitive it is to exchange-rate-only variation versus foreign prices, and run balance/placebo tests to see whether KZT/USD-driven changes in the instrument also predict outcomes that should not respond to imported inflation.",
  "e_import_share_to_imported_inflation_instrument": "Higher import share mechanically enters the construction of the imported-inflation instrument as an exposure weight, so units with larger import shares receive a larger loading on the same external price shocks. The main risk is not causal misspecification but measurement and definitional error (e.g., time-varying import shares treated as static, mismeasured trade shares, mismatched sector/country aggregation) that can induce attenuation or spurious cross-sectional variation in the instrument. Next, a researcher should verify the exact formula and units, confirm the import-share measure is predetermined relative to the outcome window, and run robustness checks to alternative base years/definitions of import share and to allowing modest time variation.",
  "total_capital_kspi_to_k2_ratio_kspi": "This edge represents a mechanical accounting link: the K2 (capital adequacy) ratio is defined as total capital divided by risk\u2011weighted assets, so increases in total capital should translate into a higher K2 ratio holding RWA fixed. The main risk to interpretation is that the ratio\u2019s denominator (RWA) may change simultaneously with capital (e.g., balance-sheet expansion, risk reclassification, regulatory adjustments), so a regression of the ratio on total capital can look weak or even misleading despite the identity. A researcher should verify the exact construction and timing/units of both series and explicitly account for RWA (e.g., include RWA as a control or model the identity directly) to ensure the estimate is not being driven by denominator movements, scaling, or measurement error.",
  "nominal_expenditure_to_real_expenditure": "This edge captures the accounting/measurement link between nominal expenditure and real expenditure: real expenditure is constructed by deflating nominal spending by a price index, so changes in nominal spending mechanically map into changes in the real series holding the deflator fixed. The main risk is not omitted-variable bias but mismeasurement and definition drift\u2014e.g., using an inappropriate deflator, changes in the basket/quality adjustment, rebasing, or mixing nominal and real components\u2014which can create spurious co-movement or attenuate relationships. A researcher should verify the exact deflation formula, deflator source/timing (CPI vs PCE, chain-weighting, base year), and ensure consistent units and frequency alignment; also check robustness to alternative deflators and to using log differences rather than levels if trends dominate.",
  "cpi_headline_to_real_expenditure": "Higher headline CPI inflation is associated with lower measured real expenditure because real spending is typically constructed by deflating nominal expenditure with a price index; mechanically, a higher deflator reduces the real (quantity) measure holding nominal spending fixed. The main risk is that the reduced-form estimate is dominated by this accounting identity and by measurement/seasonal adjustment mismatches (e.g., CPI not matching the relevant consumption deflator, base-year changes, timing differences), so the coefficient may not reflect behavioral responses in consumption at all. Next, the researcher should verify the exact deflation formula and deflator used in constructing `real_expenditure`, check units/log transformations and alignment of inflation vs price level, and consider re-estimating using nominal expenditure with CPI separately (or using the appropriate PCE/consumption deflator) to separate mechanical from economic relationships.",
  "nominal_income_to_real_income": "This identity edge represents the mechanical accounting link between nominal income and real income: real income is nominal income adjusted by the price level/deflator, so changes in nominal income map into changes in purchasing power one-for-one up to inflation. The main risk to interpreting the estimate is not omitted variables but mismatch and measurement error\u2014e.g., using different deflators across units/time, base-year rebasing, or compositional changes that make the \u201creal\u201d adjustment non-comparable\u2014which can make the empirical coefficient deviate from its implied identity. Next, the researcher should verify the exact deflation formula and units (levels vs logs), confirm the deflator corresponds to the same population and period as nominal income, and check whether the near-but-not-equal-to-1 estimate is explained by inflation variation, timing differences, or data revisions.",
  "cor_kspi_to_total_capital_kspi": "",
  "cpi_nontradable_to_cpi_headline": "",
  "cpi_tradable_to_cpi_headline": "This edge represents the mechanical aggregation channel: inflation in tradable goods is a component of the overall consumer price index, so movements in tradable CPI typically feed into headline CPI through expenditure weights and index construction. The main risk is that treating this as an estimable \u201ceffect\u201d is misleading because the relationship is partly definitional and can be distorted by reweighting, base-year changes, and differences in seasonal adjustment or coverage between the series; the auto-bridging note also flags a substantive mismatch risk if the two CPI measures are not constructed consistently. Next, the researcher should verify the CPI formula and weights (and whether tradables are a strict subset of headline), align vintages/seasonal-adjustment/base periods, and check whether the coefficient roughly matches the implied average weight of tradables in the headline basket over the sample (including allowing for time-varying weights)."
