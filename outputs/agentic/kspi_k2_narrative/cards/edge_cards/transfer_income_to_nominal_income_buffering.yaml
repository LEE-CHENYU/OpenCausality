    excerpt: This paper considers a simple quantitative model of output, interest
      rate and inflation determination in the United States, and uses it to evaluate
      alternative rules by which the Fed may set interest rates. The model is derived
      from optimizing behavior under rational expectations, both on the part o

    excerpt: There is a well-established cross-sectional association between income
      and health, but estimates of the causal effects of income vary substantially.
      Different definitions of income may lead to substantially different empirical
      results, yet research is often framed as investigating “the effect of inc

    excerpt: Job stability - encompassing secure contracts, adequate wages, social
