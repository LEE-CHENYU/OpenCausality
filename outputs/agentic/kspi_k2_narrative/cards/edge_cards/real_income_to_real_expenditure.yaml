    authors:
    - John Gerard Ruggie
    year: 1982
    excerpt: The prevailing model of international economic regimes is strictly positivistic
      in its epistemological orientation and stresses the distribution of material
      power capabilities in its explanatory logic. It is inadequate to account for
      the current set of international economic regimes and for the diff

    year: 1997
    excerpt: This paper considers a simple quantitative model of output, interest
      rate and inflation determination in the United States, and uses it to evaluate
      alternative rules by which the Fed may set interest rates. The model is derived
      from optimizing behavior under rational expectations, both on the part o

    excerpt: We study the asymmetric effect of consumption expenditure on Saudi imports
      from 1991 to 2020. We found a direct relationship between consumption expenditure
      and imports both in short and long-run periods, however, the positive shocks
      in consumption expenditures have a dominant impact in the long run
