  "global_activity_shock": "**Role**: `global_activity_shock` is meant to capture exogenous swings in world real activity (IGREA innovations) that should propagate into Kazakhstan mainly through external demand and global risk/commodity channels.\n\n**Blocker (ESTIMATION)**: The DAG already routes \u201cglobal conditions\u201d through `oil_demand_shock -> kzt_usd` and `vix_shock -> kzt_usd` (and then into `brent_price`, CPI, and `nbk_policy_rate`), so while `global_activity_shock` conceptually affects `oil_demand_shock`, `brent_price`, and/or `vix_shock`, those additional edges have not been estimated/parameterized and would be partly duplicative given the existing global-factor nodes that are already wired.\n\n**Path forward**: Estimate and fix a single, identified linkage\u2014e.g., add and estimate `global_activity_shock -> oil_demand_shock` (and optionally test whether `global_activity_shock -> vix_shock` adds incremental explanatory power beyond `vix_shock`) using the same external IGREA series and then keep only the non-redundant edge(s); otherwise remove `global_activity_shock` if it does not add variation beyond the existing `oil_demand_shock`/`vix_shock` structure.",
  "E_import_share": "**Role**: `E_import_share` is a *time-invariant exposure* node meant to capture cross-regional heterogeneity in how exchange-rate\u2013driven tradable inflation passes through to local prices, incomes, and ultimately bank credit risk.\n\n**Blocker (DESIGN)**: The current DAG is effectively a **single time-series macro \u2192 banking** structure (e.g., `oil_*_shock/vix_shock -> kzt_usd -> cpi_* -> nbk_policy_rate -> {deposit_cost_kspi, cor_kspi}` plus the IV path `imported_inflation_instrument -> {npl_kspi, cor_kspi}`), so there is **no region panel/outcome node or interaction structure** where a static regional share can enter\u2014without region-level outcomes, wiring `E_import_share` would be either non-identified (purely cross-sectional) or would implicitly require an unmodeled design like `kzt_usd \u00d7 E_import_share -> cpi_tradable` / `real_expenditure` that the DAG does not currently support.\n\n**Path forward**: Add a region (or bank-region) panel layer and encode heterogeneous pass-through by introducing interaction/shift-share edges such as `(kzt_usd, brent_price) -> imported_inflation_instrument` with `E_import_share` as the exposure (or explicitly `kzt_usd \u00d7 E_import_share -> cpi_tradable_region` / `real_expenditure_region -> payments_revenue_kspi_region`), then estimate with a Bartik/DiD-style specification using region fixed effects; otherwise remove `E_import_share` as redundant in a purely aggregate DAG.",
