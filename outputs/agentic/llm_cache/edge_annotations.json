  "oil_supply_to_brent": "An oil supply shock is associated with movements in the Brent price, capturing how unexpected changes in global oil availability translate into market pricing of crude. A key risk is that the \u201cexogenous\u201d shock series may still embed demand news, inventory/precautionary demand, or contemporaneous policy/geopolitical information that also affects Brent, which would confound the reduced-form mapping and potentially distort the sign or magnitude. Another concern is timing/aggregation (e.g., monthly identification vs. higher-frequency price adjustment) and measurement error in the shock that can attenuate estimates. Next, check robustness to alternative oil shock measures (e.g., Kilian-type decompositions), verify the dynamic response via local projections/VAR impulse responses, and test for sensitivity to controlling for global activity, inventories, and financial conditions to ensure the shock is not proxying for broader macro news.",
  "oil_supply_to_fx": "",
  "oil_demand_to_fx": "This edge means that global oil demand shocks are associated with movements in the KZT/USD exchange rate, consistent with Kazakhstan behaving like a commodity currency whose terms of trade improve when oil demand strengthens. A key risk is that the \u201coil demand shock\u201d measure may still bundle global growth/financial risk shocks that simultaneously move capital flows and the dollar, creating omitted-variable bias or conflating demand with broader risk-on/risk-off dynamics; additionally, FX responses can reflect central bank intervention, capital controls, or anticipatory pricing that complicates timing. Next, a researcher should check identification of the oil-demand shock (e.g., alternative global demand instruments or sign/zero restrictions), test robustness to controlling for global dollar strength and risk sentiment (DXY, VIX, global rates), and verify the impulse timing (does KZT move after the shock rather than before) and stability across regimes (pre/post major policy changes or oil-price collapses).",
  "vix_to_fx": "A VIX shock is associated with movements in KZT/USD through the EM \u201crisk-off\u201d channel: higher global risk aversion tends to trigger outflows from emerging markets and pressure local currencies, shifting the exchange rate. A key risk is that this reduced-form link may be confounded by concurrent global factors (oil price shocks, US rate surprises, global dollar strength) that move both VIX and KZT/USD, and by timing/market-hours issues that blur the direction of comovement\u2014especially given the imprecise estimate (large SE, high p-value). Next, check robustness to controlling for Brent/Urals oil, DXY, US Treasury yields/Fed surprises, and test alternative event windows/lags (and possibly local trading-hour-aligned changes) to see whether the association strengthens and whether the sign is stable across subsamples (e.g., crises vs calm periods).",
  "fx_to_cpi_tradable": "A change in the KZT/USD exchange rate causes a change in tradable CPI by altering local-currency prices of imported consumption goods and imported inputs used in tradable production; the estimate implies about 11.3% pass-through from FX movements into tradable consumer prices over the study horizon. Key risks include violations of the identification assumptions\u2014e.g., exchange-rate moves coinciding with unobserved shocks to import prices, tariffs, subsidies, administered prices, or demand conditions that also affect tradable CPI\u2014plus measurement/aggregation issues in the tradable CPI basket and potential nonlinear or state-dependent pass-through during crises. Next, the researcher should scrutinize the identifying variation and timing (event-study/pre-trends, placebo outcomes), test robustness to controlling for global commodity prices and foreign inflation, and check heterogeneity by import intensity/category and asymmetry between depreciations and appreciations.",
  "fx_to_cpi_nontradable": "This edge represents the causal effect of KZT/USD exchange-rate movements on prices of non-tradable goods and services, where theory would typically suggest little direct pass-through because these items are not imported and have limited foreign-input content. The near-zero estimate is consistent with non-tradables being insulated from exchange-rate shocks, making it a useful falsification check for broader pass-through claims. Key risks are misclassification of \u201cnon-tradable\u201d items (hidden imported inputs or regulated tariffs), CPI measurement/aggregation that masks sectoral effects, and identification failure if the exchange-rate variation used is endogenous to domestic inflation expectations or policy responses. Next, the researcher should verify the tradable/non-tradable basket construction and input import intensity, run event-study/lag specifications and subcomponents (services vs. shelter vs. administered prices), and test robustness to alternative instruments or shock definitions and to excluding periods with price controls or tax changes.",
  "cpi_to_nbk_rate": "This edge represents the NBK\u2019s reaction function: headline inflation may be related to subsequent policy-rate adjustments as the central bank leans against inflationary pressure. The main risk is that this relationship is blocked or confounded by omitted drivers (e.g., exchange rate movements, output gap, global commodity prices, fiscal shocks) or by reverse timing/measurement issues (policy affecting inflation with lags while inflation data reflect earlier conditions), which can wash out the apparent link\u2014consistent with the extremely imprecise estimate and near-zero statistical signal here. Next, verify timing and information sets (use real-time CPI releases and meeting dates), add key controls and lags typical of Taylor-type rules, and check robustness across regimes (e.g., pre/post policy framework changes) to see whether CPI predicts rate moves in subsamples or at specific horizons.",
  "fx_to_nbk_rate": "",
  "nbk_rate_to_deposit_cost": "A higher NBK policy rate is plausibly related to higher deposit funding costs at KSPI through the standard monetary transmission \u201cfunding cost channel,\u201d where banks must offer higher rates to retain/attract deposits. The main risk is that this edge is not identified: concurrent shocks (inflation expectations, FX pressure, liquidity stress, regulatory changes, or risk-premium shifts) can move the policy rate and KSPI\u2019s effective deposit cost together, and deposit-cost measurement/composition changes (term mix, retail vs corporate, promotional pricing) can mechanically generate the association. Next, verify the required connectors and timing by checking event-study dynamics around policy announcements, controlling for macro/market confounders (inflation, KZT/USD, sovereign spreads, system liquidity), and testing whether the pass-through differs by deposit type/maturity or by the share of sticky vs rate-sensitive deposits.",
  "nbk_rate_to_cor": "A higher NBK policy rate may be related to a subsequent rise in the KSPI corporate NPL (or distress) measure through the borrower-stress channel: higher debt-service costs and tighter financial conditions can worsen firms\u2019 repayment capacity, with a plausible two-quarter lag before deterioration is realized in bank portfolios. The main risk to a causal interpretation is endogeneity of policy: the NBK may raise rates in response to macro conditions (inflation, overheating, FX pressure, commodity shocks) that also independently affect corporate credit quality, plus omitted concurrent macroprudential actions or regulatory changes that shift measured impairment. Next, a researcher should check robustness to controlling for the NBK reaction function and common macro drivers (output gap, inflation, exchange rate, oil/commodity prices), test alternative lag structures and pre-trends, and verify that cor_kspi measurement/accounting rules and loan classification practices are stable over time.",
  "cpi_to_nominal_income": "A rise in headline CPI causes an increase in nominal income, consistent with wage/earnings indexation, cost-of-living adjustments, and price passthrough into nominal pay and receipts. The main threat is that the imported-inflation instrument could still shift nominal income through channels other than domestic CPI (e.g., trade exposure affecting labor demand, sectoral composition, or terms-of-trade income), or that the LP specification is contaminated by anticipatory wage setting or differential measurement/timing of CPI versus income. Next, check exclusion and monotonicity more directly by testing balance on pre-trends and trade-exposure covariates, running sector/region heterogeneity and placebo outcomes (e.g., employment or hours), and verifying robustness to alternative CPI definitions (core vs headline) and income measures (wages vs total household/firm income).",
  "fx_to_real_expenditure": "A rise in **kzt_usd** (a KZT depreciation against the USD) **causes** a decline in **real_expenditure**, consistent with exchange-rate pass-through raising the domestic price of imported consumption/investment goods and tightening real purchasing power; the IRF(0) of -0.10 suggests an immediate contraction. The main threats are violations of the identification assumptions\u2014e.g., contemporaneous monetary/fiscal or commodity-price shocks moving both the exchange rate and spending, anticipatory behavior (expenditure falling before the depreciation), or measurement/deflation issues that mechanically induce a negative response. Next, check pre-trends/placebo leads and sensitivity to alternative identification (e.g., different shock ordering/instruments), and verify robustness across deflators (CPI vs. PCE) and subsamples (oil-price regimes, crisis periods) to ensure the effect isn\u2019t driven by correlated external shocks or inflation mismeasurement.",
  "shock_to_npl_kspi": "An increase in the imported-inflation instrument is associated with higher NPLs in KSPI, consistent with a macro price shock that may squeeze real incomes, raise input costs, or tighten financial conditions and thereby worsen repayment capacity. The main risk to interpreting this as a clean reduced-form shock transmission is that the instrument could be correlated with other contemporaneous forces affecting NPLs (e.g., exchange-rate movements, policy responses, sectoral demand shocks) or that bank-level exposure/composition shifts mechanically change measured NPLs. Given the note that channels can\u2019t be decomposed without loan-level data, the next checks should focus on validating the instrument\u2019s exogeneity (placebo tests on pre-trends and unaffected outcomes, robustness to adding exchange rate/monetary policy controls) and exploring heterogeneity using available aggregates (e.g., by sectoral loan shares, maturity structure, or borrower type) to see whether the response aligns with plausible pass-through mechanisms.",
  "shock_to_cor_kspi": "",
  "expenditure_to_payments_revenue": "Higher real_expenditure is associated with higher payments_revenue_kspi, consistent with a channel where customer spending increases GMV that flows through the KSPI connector into interchange and fee-based payments revenue. A key risk is that expenditure may be proxying for broader demand or seasonality that also directly raises payments revenue (e.g., promotions, macro conditions, merchant mix), and connector availability/measurement issues could induce selection or attenuation if KSPI coverage changes over time. Next, check whether the relationship is stable across periods with constant KSPI integration (and across cohorts/markets), and validate the GMV\u2192interchange\u2192revenue linkage by testing intermediate outcomes (GMV, connected share, take rate) and ruling out concurrent pricing or tracking changes.",
  "cor_to_capital": "Higher loan-loss provisioning (cor_kspi) mechanically causes lower total regulatory capital (total_capital_kspi) because provisions flow through earnings and reduce retained earnings/CET1 under standard accounting and capital rules. The main threat to interpreting the magnitude as causal is that provisioning is typically prompted by underlying credit deterioration that also affects capital through other channels (charge-offs, risk-weight changes, supervisory actions), and any \u201ccontrol for PPOP\u201d may not fully net out simultaneous income shocks or timing mismatches. Next, verify the exact capital definition and mapping (e.g., CET1 vs total capital, treatment of expected-loss reserves) and run timing/robustness checks (lags, event-study around provisioning spikes) to confirm the relationship is purely accounting-mechanical rather than driven by concurrent balance-sheet or regulatory adjustments.",
  "loan_portfolio_to_rwa": "This edge represents the accounting/regulatory mapping from loan portfolio volume into risk\u2011weighted assets: holding the average risk weight fixed, increasing loan exposures causes a proportional increase in RWA by construction (Volume \u00d7 avg RW), so the coefficient is essentially a scaling factor. The main risk to interpreting this as a stable causal effect is that \u201cavg RW\u201d is not actually fixed\u2014changes in portfolio composition, IRB model updates, regulatory parameter shifts, or RWA optimization can make RWA respond non-proportionally to volume and break the purely mechanical relationship. Next, verify that the definition of loan_portfolio_kspi matches the exposure measure used in RWA (EAD vs book value, netting, CRM, off\u2011balance sheet CCFs) and check whether the implied average risk weight (RWA/Volume) is constant over time or varies with composition/regime changes.",
  "portfolio_mix_to_rwa": "",
  "capital_to_k2": "Higher total capital mechanically increases the K2 ratio because \\(K2 = \\frac{\\text{Total Capital}}{\\text{RWA}}\\); holding RWA fixed, a one-unit increase in capital raises K2 one-for-one scaled by \\(1/\\text{RWA}\\). The main risk to interpreting the 0.0625 as a stable \u201ccausal effect\u201d is that RWA is in the denominator and typically varies with portfolio risk, regulation, and measurement choices, so changes in capital may coincide with changes in RWA that alter the mapping from capital to K2. A researcher should verify the exact construction and units (e.g., whether K2 is in percentage points and capital/RWA in consistent currency terms), check for any smoothing/averaging or reporting lags, and confirm that RWA is treated consistently across time and banks so the implied derivative \\(dK2/dCapital \\approx 1/\\text{RWA}\\) matches the estimate.",
  "rwa_to_k2": "Higher RWA mechanically lowers the K2 ratio because \\(K2=\\frac{\\text{Total Capital}}{\\text{RWA}}\\); holding capital fixed, an increase in the denominator reduces the ratio one-for-one in proportional terms. The main risk is not causal invalidity but measurement/definition mismatches (e.g., capital and RWA not aligned in time, consolidation scope, or regulatory definition changes) and any data construction that induces non-classical error, which can make the identity fail empirically. Next, verify unit consistency and timing (same reporting date), confirm the exact capital numerator used (e.g., total vs. Tier 2/total regulatory capital), and recompute K2 directly from the underlying components to ensure the estimated coefficient reflects the accounting identity rather than a coding artifact."
