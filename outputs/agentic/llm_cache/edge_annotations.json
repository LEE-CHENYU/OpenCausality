  "oil_supply_to_brent": "An oil supply shock (e.g., an unexpected disruption or expansion in crude production) is associated with a movement in the Brent benchmark price, capturing how global supply news is reflected in spot/futures pricing. The key risk is that the \u201cexogenous\u201d shock series may still embed demand or risk-premium information (or be contaminated by measurement error and timing/anticipation), so the reduced-form association could partly reflect simultaneous macro news rather than pure supply shifts. A researcher should check robustness to alternative shock measures and timing (e.g., high-frequency windows around identified events), verify the sign/units and scaling of the shock so the negative estimate is interpretable, and test for predictability by pre-trends or other global demand indicators that would suggest the instrument is not orthogonal to demand shocks.",
  "oil_supply_to_fx": "",
  "oil_demand_to_fx": "An oil demand shock is associated with movements in the KZT/USD exchange rate, consistent with Kazakhstan\u2019s \u201ccommodity currency\u201d channel where stronger global oil demand tends to improve expected export revenues and the external balance, putting pressure on the tenge to strengthen (a lower KZT/USD). A key risk is that the oil-demand shock measure may still embed broader global risk-on/risk-off conditions or dollar strength that independently move EM exchange rates, and policy responses (FX intervention, rate changes, capital controls) could alter the mapping from oil demand to the exchange rate. Given the borderline significance (p\u22480.064), the next step is to probe robustness by controlling for global financial conditions (e.g., DXY, VIX, US rates) and checking timing/identification (event windows, alternative shock series), plus heterogeneity across regimes (pre/post major interventions or oil-price collapses).",
  "vix_to_fx": "A VIX shock is associated with movements in the KZT/USD exchange rate, consistent with an EM \u201crisk-off\u201d channel where global volatility coincides with capital outflows and changes in demand for dollar liquidity. The main risk is that the VIX shock is not exogenous to Kazakhstan-relevant global news (e.g., oil or Russia/China shocks) so the estimate may mix multiple global factors; additionally, time-zone alignment, overlapping announcement windows, and contemporaneous policy reactions can attenuate or flip the sign. Next, check robustness to controlling for oil prices and broad USD strength (DXY), test alternative event windows/lags (including leads to diagnose anticipation), and verify the sign interpretation given the KZT/USD quote (whether a negative estimate corresponds to appreciation vs depreciation).",
  "fx_to_cpi_tradable": "A depreciation of KZT against USD causes an increase in tradable CPI via import prices and pricing of tradables in foreign currency, capturing exchange-rate pass-through into consumer prices for goods exposed to international competition. Key threats to this causal interpretation are policy endogeneity (e.g., exchange-rate adjustments responding to inflation shocks), omitted global cost shocks (oil, shipping, partner-country inflation) that move both FX and tradable prices, and measurement issues in the tradable CPI basket or timing/mismatch in price collection. Next, a researcher should verify robustness to controlling for external price indices and commodity prices, check pre-trends and alternative lag structures to confirm timing of pass-through, and test stability of the 11.3% estimate across regimes (pegs/floats, crisis vs calm periods) and subsamples.",
  "fx_to_cpi_nontradable": "A causal effect from KZT/USD to non\u2011tradable CPI would represent exchange-rate pass\u2011through into prices of locally produced services and goods that rely little on imported inputs; the near-zero estimate suggests essentially no direct pass\u2011through into the non\u2011tradables basket over the horizon studied. Key risks are that the \u201cidentified\u201d variation in the exchange rate may still coincide with demand-management or price-admin measures that specifically target services, that non\u2011tradable CPI may be contaminated by tradable components or regulated prices, or that the effect is delayed/nonlinear (showing up only in large devaluations) and thus missed by a linear average estimate. Next, check robustness to alternative non\u2011tradable definitions and exclusions (administered/regulated prices), longer lags and distributed\u2011lag specifications, and state dependence (e.g., devaluation episodes vs normal times) to confirm the falsification holds outside the baseline window.",
  "cpi_to_nbk_rate": "This edge represents the central bank reaction function: when headline CPI changes, the NBK may adjust its policy rate in response to inflation pressures relative to its objectives. A key risk is that the measured relationship can be distorted by simultaneous shocks (e.g., exchange-rate or commodity-price movements) that affect both inflation and policy decisions, as well as by expectation and information timing\u2014policy is set on forecasts, while CPI is observed with lags and revisions. Given the very imprecise estimate (large SE, high p-value), the next step is to verify timing/measurement (use real-time CPI and meeting dates, or forecast inflation), include major confounders (FX, output gap, oil/food prices, fiscal shocks), and check for regime changes or nonlinearity (e.g., different responses when inflation is above target or during crises).",
  "fx_to_nbk_rate": "",
  "nbk_rate_to_deposit_cost": "A higher NBK policy rate is meant to transmit through the funding-cost channel, raising banks\u2019 marginal cost of funds and therefore increasing KSPI\u2019s deposit funding cost. A key risk is that the policy rate moves in response to the same macro/financial conditions that also affect deposit pricing (e.g., inflation expectations, liquidity stress, exchange-rate pressure), and incomplete pass-through or simultaneous changes in reserve requirements/FX regulations could break the assumed connector path. Next, a researcher should verify the \u201cboth connectors\u201d assumption by checking timing and pass-through (event-study around rate decisions, lag structure, and heterogeneity by deposit maturity/currency), and test robustness to controlling for macro conditions and liquidity measures that might jointly drive both the policy rate and deposit costs.",
  "nbk_rate_to_cor": "A higher NBK policy rate may be related to subsequent movements in the corporate KSPI through the borrower-stress channel: tighter monetary conditions raise debt-service burdens and refinancing risk, which can worsen corporate credit quality and feed into equity pricing with about a two-quarter lag. The main risk is that this edge may not be identified because policy rates react to macro and financial conditions that also move the corporate index (reverse causality), and because omitted factors like oil prices, exchange-rate shocks, or global risk appetite could drive both rates and equities; additionally, the 2Q lag may still pick up anticipated policy paths rather than a clean shock. Next, the researcher should check whether the \u201crate change\u201d is an exogenous monetary policy shock (e.g., high-frequency surprise or narrative shock) and test robustness to controlling for inflation/output surprises, FX and oil shocks, and global factors, as well as alternative lag structures and pre-trends/event-study style dynamics.",
  "cpi_to_nominal_income": "A rise in headline CPI causes an increase in nominal income, consistent with partial pass-through of inflation into wage growth, transfers, or other nominal earnings as households and firms adjust contracts. The main threats are violations of the imported-inflation IV exclusion restriction (e.g., import-price shocks affecting nominal income directly via trade exposure, sectoral demand, or firm profitability) and any differential macro policy responses to imported inflation that independently move income. Next, check instrument strength and robustness to alternative exposure measures, and run balance/placebo tests (e.g., pre-trends and outcomes that should not respond) plus heterogeneity by import intensity to ensure the channel is truly through domestic prices rather than direct trade-income effects.",
  "fx_to_real_expenditure": "A higher KZT/USD (a depreciation of the tenge) causes real expenditure to fall on impact, consistent with a contractionary expenditure response through reduced purchasing power for imports, higher inflation/real income compression, and tighter financial conditions for FX-exposed firms and households. Key risks to the causal interpretation include residual policy endogeneity (the exchange rate moving with unobserved monetary/fiscal actions), mismeasurement/deflation issues in \u201creal\u201d expenditure during high inflation or price controls, and compositional shifts (nominal spending reallocated toward higher prices rather than lower quantities). Next, the researcher should verify robustness to alternative deflators and expenditure definitions, test for pre-trends/anticipation and sensitivity to the identification scheme (e.g., alternative shock measures or ordering), and check heterogeneity by import intensity/FX debt exposure to see if the mechanism aligns with the estimated \u22120.10 IRF(0).",
  "shock_to_npl_kspi": "A rise in the imported-inflation instrument is associated with higher NPLs for KSPI, consistent with an external price shock deteriorating borrower repayment capacity and/or raising funding and operating costs that feed into credit quality. This reduced-form link could be invalidated if the instrument also loads on other concurrent macro shocks (e.g., exchange-rate stress, policy tightening, demand slowdown) that independently predict KSPI NPLs, or if KSPI\u2019s exposure differs systematically over time in ways correlated with the instrument. Next, check instrument relevance and timing (first stage strength, leads/lags, pre-trends), add controls for exchange rates, policy rates, and activity to probe robustness, and run placebo tests on outcomes that should not respond; to unpack channels, prioritize obtaining loan-level or sectoral exposure data to see whether NPL increases concentrate in import-intensive or price-sensitive borrower segments.",
  "shock_to_cor_kspi": "The edge from the imported inflation instrument to CoR (KSPI) captures how an external imported-inflation shock is associated with contemporaneous movements in banks\u2019 cost of risk, plausibly through macro stress on borrowers and collateral values. A key risk is that the instrument may pick up other global shocks (risk-off episodes, commodity/FX shocks, monetary tightening) that also predict CoR through channels unrelated to imported inflation, and the latent IFRS 9 overlay could induce measurement error or regime-dependent provisioning that changes the reduced-form sensitivity. You should next probe instrument validity and stability by testing for pre-trends/leads, adding controls for global financial conditions and domestic policy responses, and checking heterogeneity or breaks around periods when overlays or provisioning rules likely changed (e.g., pandemic-era overlays).",
  "expenditure_to_payments_revenue": "Higher real expenditure is associated with higher payments_revenue_kspi, consistent with a channel where spending lifts GMV, which increases card payment volumes and interchange-like fees that flow through the KSPI connector into recorded revenue. A key risk is that expenditure may proxy for broader demand conditions or merchant mix changes that also affect take rates, connector adoption, routing, or pricing, so the estimate could reflect correlated shocks rather than incremental monetization from spending. Measurement and timing issues\u2014e.g., misalignment between when expenditure is recorded and when interchange/revenue is recognized, changes in KSPI coverage, or breaks in data pipelines\u2014could also bias the association. Next, check lead\u2013lag patterns and stability around KSPI integration/coverage changes (event-study or break tests), and validate the implied mechanism by verifying that expenditure predicts intermediate metrics (GMV, transaction counts, effective take rate) with consistent magnitudes.",
  "cor_to_capital": "Higher `cor_kspi` (loan-loss provisioning/credit risk expense) mechanically causes lower `total_capital_kspi` because provisions reduce current earnings and thus retained earnings, directly pulling down regulatory capital\u2014especially when capital is built through profits. The main threats to a clean causal interpretation are mismeasurement or definitional overlap between the provisioning variable and capital components, and any simultaneity where low capital triggers supervisory actions that change provisioning practices; failing to net out operating profitability (hence controlling for PPOP) can also confound the net mechanical effect through the income statement. Next, verify variable construction and accounting mapping (does `cor_kspi` flow through the same equity/capital items in `total_capital_kspi`), check timing (whether provisions hit capital in the same period or with lags), and run a decomposition showing how much of the estimated effect operates via net income versus other capital adjustments.",
  "loan_portfolio_to_rwa": "A larger loan portfolio mechanically causes higher RWA because RWA is constructed as exposure volume multiplied by (average) regulatory risk weights; holding average RW fixed, scaling up loans scales up RWA one-for-one in proportion. The main risk to treating the estimated coefficient as informative is that average risk weights may change with portfolio size (composition shifts, IRB model changes, securitizations, or measurement/definition mismatches between \u201cloan portfolio\u201d and the exposure base used in RWA), making the mapping non-constant even if the accounting identity holds in principle. Next, verify that the loan_portfolio measure aligns with the RWA exposure perimeter (on/off-balance-sheet, netting, credit conversion factors) and check stability of the implied average RW over time and across banks to confirm the coefficient reflects the intended mechanical identity rather than coincident reporting changes.",
  "portfolio_mix_to_rwa": "",
  "capital_to_k2": "This edge reflects a mechanical accounting relationship: holding risk\u2011weighted assets (RWA) fixed, higher total regulatory capital increases the K2 capital ratio by construction because \\(K2 = \\text{Total Capital}/\\text{RWA}\\). The main risk to interpreting the estimate as a \u201ccausal effect\u201d is that the identity is conditional on the denominator and definitions\u2014changes in RWA, capital measurement (regulatory adjustments), consolidation scope, or timing mismatches can break the one-for-one mapping implied by the formula and make the coefficient look \u201cestimated\u201d rather than exact. Next, the researcher should verify that K2 is computed from the same total capital series and the same-period RWA used in the dataset, and check whether any regulatory regime changes, restatements, or data cleaning steps could introduce deviations from the identity.",
