**Study Version:** 4.0 (Oil exposure only in main spec)

## Data Summary

| Data Source | Observations | Coverage |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| BNS Income | 846 rows | 14 regions, 2010Q1-2025Q3 |
| Mining Shares (USGS/EITI) | 16 regions | E_oil_r: [0.00, 0.32] |
| Cyclical Proxy (GRP) | 16 regions | E_cyc_proxy: [0.25, 0.85] |
| Baumeister Shocks | 608 months | 1975-2025 |
| FRED IGREA | 311 months | Global activity innovation |

**Analysis Sample:** 746 observations (14 regions × ~53 quarters)

**Missing Regions:** West Kazakhstan, North Kazakhstan (critical: both are oil regions)

## Main Specification (Oil Only)

```
log_income_pc = α_r + δ_t + β₁(E_oil_r × oil_supply_shock)
                         + β₂(E_oil_r × aggregate_demand_shock) + u_{r,t}
```

### Results

| Coefficient | Estimate | Std. Error | p-value | Significant? |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------|--------------|
| E_oil_r × oil_supply | 0.0351 | 0.0396 | 0.375 | No |
| E_oil_r × aggregate_demand | -0.0024 | 0.1075 | 0.983 | No |

- **N observations:** 746
- **R² within:** -0.0008
- **Covariance:** Driscoll-Kraay (kernel)

### Interpretation

A 1 standard deviation oil supply shock would change log income by:
- High-oil region (Atyrau, E_oil=0.32): 0.0351 × 0.32 = 0.011 (1.1%)
- Low-oil region (Almaty, E_oil=0.00): 0.0351 × 0.00 = 0.000 (0.0%)
- Differential: 1.1 percentage points

**But p=0.375, so this is statistically indistinguishable from zero.**

## Robustness Specification (Add Cyclical Proxy)

```
log_income_pc = α_r + δ_t + β₁(E_oil_r × oil_supply_shock)
                         + β₂(E_oil_r × aggregate_demand_shock)
                         + θ(E_cyc_proxy_r × global_activity_shock) + u_{r,t}
```

### Results

| Coefficient | Estimate | Std. Error | p-value | Significant? |
|-------------|----------|------------|---------|--------------|
| E_oil_r × oil_supply | 0.0513 | 0.0439 | 0.244 | No |
| E_oil_r × aggregate_demand | -0.0129 | 0.1085 | 0.905 | No |
| E_cyc_proxy_r × global_activity | -0.0030 | 0.0017 | 0.086 | Marginal* |

- **N observations:** 746
- **R² within:** -0.0102
- **Covariance:** Driscoll-Kraay (kernel)

### Interpretation

The cyclical proxy is marginally significant (p=0.086), suggesting:
- Regions with higher cyclical employment exposure may be more sensitive to global activity
- But this is based on a GRP proxy, NOT true employment data
- Interpret with caution

## Beta Stability Check

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| β (main spec) | 0.0351 |
| β (robustness spec) | 0.0513 |
| Change | +0.0161 |
| % Change | **46%** |
| Stable? | **NO** (threshold: <20%) |

### Interpretation

The oil coefficient changes substantially when adding the cyclical proxy. This suggests:
1. Omitted variable bias in the main spec
2. Or multicollinearity between oil and cyclical exposure
3. Or specification sensitivity

However, since **both coefficients are insignificant**, this instability doesn't change the conclusion: no detectable oil effects.

---

## Conclusion

### Primary Finding: NULL

**There is no statistically significant evidence that global oil shocks differentially affect high-oil-exposure regions in Kazakhstan.**

### Key Statistics
- All oil coefficients: p > 0.20
- R² within: negative (model adds noise)
- β stability: failed (changes 46%)

### Caveats
1. Missing income data for 2 oil regions (West Kazakhstan, North Kazakhstan)
2. Oil exposure from alternative sources (USGS/EITI), not direct BNS measurement
3. Cyclical proxy is GRP-based, not employment
4. Sample: only 14 of 16 regions

### Policy Implication

**Do not use these estimates for policy.** The uncertainty bounds include zero, and the model has poor explanatory power.

## Replication

```bash
# Build panel
PYTHONPATH=. kzwelfare build-panel

# Estimate all specifications
PYTHONPATH=. kzwelfare estimate all

# Check beta stability
PYTHONPATH=. python -c "
from src.model.shift_share import ShiftShareModel
import pandas as pd
panel = pd.read_parquet('data/processed/panel.parquet')
model = ShiftShareModel(panel)
stability = model.check_beta_stability()
print(stability)
"
```
