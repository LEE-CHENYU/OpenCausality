# Edge Card Comparison Report

**Generated:** 2026-02-05T22:53:10.334453
**Run A (baseline):** `outputs/agentic`
**Run B (new):** `outputs/test_run/20260205_225301`
**Run A edges:** 26
**Run B edges:** 26


## 1. Estimate Validation

Estimates should be **identical** across runs (same data + code).
Any divergence indicates a potential bug.

**PASS: All estimates match across runs.**


## 2. Credibility Rating Changes

No credibility rating changes.


## 3. Diagnostic Changes

No diagnostic pass/fail changes.


## 4. New Agentic Fields

Fields only present in Run B (identification, counterfactual_block, propagation_role).


### 4.1 Identification Blocks

**26 edges** with identification blocks.

**Claim level distribution:**

- BLOCKED_ID: 4
- IDENTIFIED_CAUSAL: 9
- REDUCED_FORM: 13

### 4.2 Counterfactual Status

**26 edges** with counterfactual assessment: 12 allowed, 14 blocked.

**Blocked edges:**

| Edge | Reason Blocked |
|------|---------------|
| cpi_to_nbk_rate | Claim level capped to BLOCKED_ID |
| expenditure_to_payments_revenue | Counterfactual Use: BLOCKED
Reason: insufficient shock episodes

Even if p<0.05, this does not establish a causal effect. |
| fx_to_nbk_rate | Counterfactual Use: BLOCKED
Reason: regime break risk

Even if p<0.05, this does not establish a causal effect. |
| nbk_rate_to_cor | Claim level capped to BLOCKED_ID |
| nbk_rate_to_deposit_cost | Claim level capped to BLOCKED_ID |
| oil_demand_to_fx | Counterfactual Use: BLOCKED
Reason: regime break risk

Even if p<0.05, this does not establish a causal effect. |
| oil_supply_to_brent | Design LOCAL_PROJECTIONS provides REDUCED_FORM level only |
| oil_supply_to_fx | Counterfactual Use: BLOCKED
Reason: regime break risk

Even if p<0.05, this does not establish a causal effect. |
| portfolio_mix_to_rwa | Claim level capped to BLOCKED_ID |
| shock_to_cor_kspi | Design LOCAL_PROJECTIONS provides REDUCED_FORM level only |
| shock_to_cor_kspi_annual | Design LOCAL_PROJECTIONS provides REDUCED_FORM level only |
| shock_to_npl_kspi | Design LOCAL_PROJECTIONS provides REDUCED_FORM level only |
| shock_to_npl_kspi_annual | Design LOCAL_PROJECTIONS provides REDUCED_FORM level only |
| vix_to_fx | Design LOCAL_PROJECTIONS provides REDUCED_FORM level only |


### 4.3 Propagation Roles

**26 edges** with propagation roles.

**Role distribution:**

- reduced_form: 26


## 5. Edge Coverage Differences

Both runs have identical edge coverage.


## 6. Summary Assessment

### Correctness
**VALIDATED**: All estimates are identical across runs. The agentic modules do not alter core estimation results.

### Agentic Value Added
- **Identification screening**: 26 edges assessed, claim levels assigned (BLOCKED_ID=4, IDENTIFIED_CAUSAL=9, REDUCED_FORM=13)
- **Counterfactual gating**: 14 edges blocked from counterfactual use
