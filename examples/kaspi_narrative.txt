When the tenge depreciates, it doesn't raise all prices equally—it shows up first and most clearly in import‑heavy parts of the CPI (like clothing, furnishings, and some food), while regulated categories (utilities, education, communications) mostly don't react, which is exactly the pattern you'd expect if the exchange rate is causally feeding "imported inflation." That imported inflation then squeezes households' purchasing power because incomes—especially wages—don't instantly adjust, so real disposable income and real spending tend to soften even if headline nominal income looks steadier on paper (often because transfers and regulated prices buffer the shock). For Kaspi, the key point is that this household squeeze can translate into balance‑sheet pressure through two main routes: repayment stress (higher delinquencies/provisions) and profitability pressure from tighter financial conditions (higher funding costs and lower margins), and there's also a direct macro channel where an increase in "macro provisioning" even before realized defaults rise. All of this ultimately matters because Kaspi's capital headroom is driven by what happens to profits and provisions (capital numerator) and by loan/risk‑weight dynamics (RWA denominator), while the holding company's ability to support the bank depends on whether consumer spending holds up enough to sustain non‑bank revenues and dividends during stress.
