We introduce OpenCausality, an open-source platform that resolves the automation-transparency tradeoff in applied causal inference. OpenCausality combines DAG-based causal reasoning with agentic estimation pipelines, where every modeling decision--from identification strategy selection to effect propagation--is logged in a hash-chained audit trail. An always-on sentinel loop runs continuously in the background, re-validating the DAG after every change, auto-fixing schema regressions, and surfacing interactive review panels--so analysts never have to hunt for results or wonder whether the specification is still valid. The platform enforces 30 issue-detection rules that catch overclaiming, control shopping, and specification drift; a 7-guardrail propagation engine that performs unit-aware dimensional analysis across multi-edge causal paths; and a 3-stage identifiability screen that downgrades claims based on diagnostic evidence rather than statistical significance alone. A 4-agent agentic loop (DataScout, ModelSmith, Estimator, Judge) iterates between estimation, issue detection, and auto-repair under LLM guidance, while an LLM-assisted pipeline extracts causal claims from the literature and proposes DAG edges--achieving 100% estimate precision on matched edges in our Kazakhstan bank stress-testing case study while discovering 3 edges absent from the expert-built DAG. All governance decisions--including human-in-the-loop gates and automated patch policies that explicitly prohibit p-hacking--are recorded with cryptographic integrity. OpenCausality ships with 19 estimation adapters spanning econometric and ML-based methods, a data-driven causal discovery agent (PC, GES, FCI, NOTEARS), a DoWhy refutation engine for post-estimation robustness, a natural-language query interface, and 204 passing tests across 49,743 lines of code.
