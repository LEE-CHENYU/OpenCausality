DAG Validation Healing:
1. Read validation errors from the provided context
2. For each error, propose minimal fix (missing deps, reaction edges, source specs)
3. Return fixes as JSON array
4. Do NOT modify estimation code or data

Each fix object should have:
  - error_type: the validation error type being addressed
  - action: one of fix_dag_identity_deps, fix_dag_missing_reaction, fix_edge_id_syntax, fix_missing_source_spec
  - details: action-specific parameters (proposed_deps, proposed_edges, old_id, connector/dataset)

Constraints:
  - Only propose nodes/edges with well-established economic mechanisms
  - Do not invent speculative relationships
  - Prefer standard data connectors (fred, bns, world_bank, nbk)
  - Keep proposed changes minimal and conservative
