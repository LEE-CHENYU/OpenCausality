Econometric DAG Estimation Pipeline - Validation & Quality Improvement

PRIMARY GOAL: Ensure all EdgeCards pass validation and report is consistent.

VALIDATION CHECKS (in order of priority):
1. Pre-estimation: DAG acyclicity, unit presence, edge type presence
2. Post-estimation: N consistency, units in EdgeCards, reaction function labels
3. Report consistency: values match EdgeCards, unit table complete, RF warnings present

ESTIMATION TASKS:
- Re-run estimation for edges with sign inconsistencies
- Update edges where validation fails
- Regenerate report after any estimate changes

KEY CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change domain knowledge decisions (expected signs, reaction function IDs)
- Do NOT add new edges without explicit instruction
- Prefer fixing validation errors over adding features
- Keep changes minimal and well-documented

QUALITY RULES:
- 80% of checks are automatable (run them!)
- 20% require domain knowledge (flag but don't change)
- Commit after each successful fix with clear message
